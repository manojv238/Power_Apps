7. AI Builder Support   ---> Add AI features like text recognition or predictions without writing any AI code.
8. Role-Based Security  ---> To control access for different user groups such as who can create, view, edit, or delete data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Difference between Canvas App and Model-Driven App?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1️⃣ Canvas Apps:
👉 Canvas Apps gives more flexibility control over the app layouts and i can design UI from scratch on a blank Canvas App. 
👉 We build apps using drag-and-drop components like buttons, galleries, forms and more.
👉 It easily connects to multiple data sources such as SharePoint, Excel, Dataverse, SQL, and more.

2️⃣ Model-Driven Apps:
👉 Model-driven apps are based on the data model in Dataverse.
👉 The UI is automatically generated based on tables, relationships, forms, and views defined in the data model.
👉 so we don’t have to design the UI manually like Canvas Apps.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Variables and types of Variables in power apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Variables is ntg but name that used to refer to a piece of information or data. This data can be of any type, such as number, string, boolean, etc.
👉 We can reuse this data across screens throughout the app.
🔹 Types of Variables:
1. Context Variables (UpdateContext): Scoped only to the current screen, created via UpdateContext().
Example: UpdateContext({ varName: "Manoj" })

2. Global Variables (Set): Accessible throughout the entire app across all screens. Created using Set().
Example: Set(varCountry, "India")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Collections and types of Collections in power apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Collections are groups of information or data it is used to store and manipulate multiple records within the app.
👉 It helps improving app performance by handling temporary data locally without hitting the data source repeatedly.
👉 Collections also support offline capabilities by storing data locally within the app.

🔹 Types of Collections:
1. Collect() function: Creates a new collection or adds records to an existing one.
✅ Example: Collect(MyCollection, {Name: "Alice", Age: 25}) or using input controls like {Name: TextInput.Text, Age: Value(TextInput.Text)}

2. ClearCollect() function: Clears all existing records from a collection and adds a new records.
✅ Example: ClearCollect(MyCollection, {Name: "Alice1", Age: 20})

3. Clear() function: Removes all records from a collection.
✅ Example: Clear(MyCollection)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What are Components in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Components are reusable building blocks or custom controls that can be create once and we can use across multiple screens.
👉 It helps to standardize design, reduced development effort and simiplify maintaince. 
👉 We can have inputs and outputs properties to make them flexible and customizable.
✅ For Example: 
👉 A custom header or navigation menu built as a component can be reused across the app.
👉 This ensures consistent UI design and makes updates easier since changes in the component reflect everywhere it’s used.

🔹 Component properties:
1. Input Property : Used to Provide values or information into the component from outside, like passing a user name or a color choice. 
2. Output Property: Used to communicate information or trigger actions from inside the component, such as notifying when a button inside the component is clicked.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Cascading Dropdown in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 A Cascading Dropdown filter the options in one dropdown based on the selection made in another dropdown.
✅ For Example: when a user selects a country, only the cities related to that country appear in the second dropdown.

✅ Country–City scenario:
Dropdown 1 (Country) ---------> Items property: Distinct(CountriesCities, Country)
Dropdown 2 (City) ------------> Items property: Filter(CountriesCities, Country = Dropdown1.Selected.Result)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Explain the concept of Delgations in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Delegation means pushing data operations like "filtering and sorting" to the data source instead of processing them inside Power Apps.
👉 This is important when working with large datasets, like SharePoint lists with thousands of records.
👉 Power Apps has a default limit of 500 records (max 2000), so using non-delegable functions can cause incomplete or incorrect data results.
👉 To avoid this, non-delegable functions are replaced with delegable ones like "Filter, Sort, and StartsWith", 
    ensuring efficient performance and accurate data retrieval.

👉 This approach improved app speed, ensured data accuracy and delivers a better user experience.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Validations in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Data validation ensures that user inputs meet specific rules or criteria before being saved. 
👉 It helps to maintain data integrity and improves user experience by prevent errors.

🔹 Power Apps offers built-in functions for Data Valadition:
👉 IsBlank()  — checks if a field is empty.
👉 IsMatch()  — validates patterns like emails or phone numbers.
👉 IsNumeric() — confirms numeric inputs.
👉 Notify()   — displays error messages to users.
👉 Conditional formatting — like changing border colors or showing warnings.

👉 This approach helps maintain data integrity and enhances the overall user experience.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. What are connectors in power apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Connectors are pre-built components that allows the app to communicate with external data sources or services.
🔹 There are two main types of connectors:
1. Standard Connectors — connect to common Microsoft services like SharePoint, Excel, Outlook, and OneDrive.
2. Premium Connectors  — provide access to advanced or third-party systems such as SQL Server, Salesforce, and custom APIs, often requiring additional licensing.

🔹 Creating a Custom Connector in Power Apps:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ To create a custom connector:
1. Navigate to Power Apps Portal > Data > Custom Connectors
2. Select New Custom Connector and choose a creation method (from blank, Postman file, or OpenAPI definition)
3. Define the connector’s name and description
4. Configure API authentication (No auth, Basic, OAuth 2.0, or API key). For secure APIs, OAuth 2.0 or API key is recommended
5. Define the connector’s actions and operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) matching the API endpoints
6. Test the connector thoroughly before integrating it into apps
7. This approach enables secure and reusable integration with external APIs beyond standard connectors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Difference between Galleries, Forms and Data Table?

✅ GALLERY:
━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Galleries are controls used to display and interact with multiple records from a data source like SharePoint.
👉 It support for dynamic layouts such as vertical, horizontal, and flexible-height galleries. 
👉 Each item can be customizable with labels, images, icons, and buttons to create interactive views.

✅ FORMS:
━━━━━━━━━
👉 Forms are controls used to viewing, creating, and editing a single record from a connected data source. 
🔹 There are three types of forms:
1. Display Form – for read-only data viewing.
2. Edit Form    – for editing existing records.
3. New Form     – for creating new records.
👉 Forms can automatically generate fields based on the selected data source and handle data binding and submission with minimal configuration.
👉 We can also customize field visibility, validation rules, and layout according to our needs.

✅ DATA TABLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Data Table is a control used to display multiple records in a tabular format, similar to an Excel sheet.
👉 It is mainly used for READ-ONLY data, where users need review the data, sorting, and scanning across rows and columns.
👉 Data tables are automatically generates rows and columns based on the connected data source.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. How do you handle errors in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Error handling in Power Apps is mainly done using the IfError() function.
👉 It catches runtime errors during actions like data submissions or calculations, allowing me to show user-friendly messages and handle issues gracefully.

✅ For example:
👉 If a data submission fails, the IfError() function can display a clear message or trigger a fallback process,
    ensuring the app handles issues gracefully without crashing or confusing users.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Can you use Offline Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Apps supports offline Capabilities usage by storing data locally using Collections and combined with the SaveData() and LoadData() functions.
👉 When connectivity is restored, sync logic with functions like Patch() and Collect() updates the server with any offline changes. 

🔹 SaveData() function: saves data on the user’s device so the app can access it offline.
🔹 LoadData() function: retrieves saved data when the app starts or reconnects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. What are the limitations of Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Apps is a powerful low-code tool, but it has some limitations we must consider.
🔹 For example:
1. It can only retrieve 500–2000 records from a data source unless delegation is handled properly.
2. Complex UI customization are limited, and app performance can slow down with too many controls.
3. Offline functionality requires manual implementation.
4. Advanced features like premium connectors or Dataverse require extra licensing.
5. There is no built-in advanced debugging or Git-style version control.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14. What is the role of Environments in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Environments are isolated containers that let us manage apps, flows, connections, and Dataverse separately.
👉 It helps isolating data and apps for different teams or projects to work independently and securely.
✅ For Example:
👉 We can create seperately environments for developing, testing and production. Each environment can have its own data policies, permissions, and resources.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15. What are Containers in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Containers are layout controls used to group and align multiple controls together —like buttons, labels, inputs into one unit.
👉 They simplify responsive design by auto-adjust spacing, and maintaining consistent alignment across different screen sizes.
👉 Containers are especially useful for mobile-first designs or when handling dynamic screen sizes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. How do you create a Responsive Design in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 To create a responsive Design in Power Apps, I use container controls like vertical and horizontal containers based on the app’s needs.
👉 These containers automatically arrange the elements inside them based on the screen size.
👉 Instead of fixing each control’s size and position, I use formulas to adjust width and height relative to the screen.
✅ For Example:
👉 Uisng relative properities like "parent.width and parent.height" it helps to adjust their sizes and positions dynamically.

👉 This approach ensures the app looks good on any device — phone, tablet, or desktop.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17. What are the Role-Based Security in Power Apps. How do you manage them?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Apps security roles define what actions users can perform on data (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) and control access to apps, forms, and records.
👉 Security roles are managed in Microsoft Dataverse and we can be customized for individual users or groups.
👉 We can assign predefined security roles like (System Adminstrator, Environment Maker) or we can create custom roles based on business needs.

✅ For Example – Employee Management App:
🔹 Admin       → Full access to all records and Settings.
🔹 Manager     → Limited access to team-specific reports.
🔹 Employee    → Can only view and edit their own profile.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18. How do you manage version control and deployment (Solutions & ALM)?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ I follow ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) best practices using Solutions in Power Apps:

👉 I use Solutions in Power Apps to group related components like apps, flows, tables, and security roles into a single package together.
👉 During development, I use Unmanaged Solutions — these allow easy editing and collaboration.
👉 Once the app is tested and finalized, I export it as a Managed Solution for the Production environment.
    which are read-only to ensure stability and controlled updates.
👉 I also maintain separate environments for Dev, Test, and Prod.
👉 We move solutions across environments using Export/Import to maintain version control and ensure smooth deployment.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19. How do you use Power Apps in implement conditional formatting in your app?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Conditional formatting in Power Apps mainly through formulas on properties like Color, Fill, or Visible.
👉 Instead of hardcoding styles, I apply logic using If statements or Switch based on field values or user roles.

✅ Common use cases:
1. Change label or text color based on status: Color = If(ThisItem.Status = "Completed", Green, Red)
2. Highlight cards or controls when a condition is met: Fill = If(ThisItem.Score < 50, RGBA(255,0,0,0.1), White)
3. Show/hide fields depending on user role: Visible = If(User().Email = "admin@domain.com", true, false)
4. Disable controls until a required field is filled: DisplayMode = If(IsBlank(DataCardValue1.Text), DisplayMode.Disabled, DisplayMode.Edit)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20. Difference between configuration and customization?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Configuration means changing settings or using built-in tools to make the system work how you want, without any coding. 
    Like changing forms, adding fields, or creating filters.

👉 Customization means writing code or building new features to change how the system works, 
    like adding custom logic or integrating with other apps.

👉 So, configuration is easier and faster, and customization is for when you need something more advanced.
