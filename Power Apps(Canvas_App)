7. AI Builder Support   ---> Add AI features like text recognition or predictions without writing any AI code.
8. Role-Based Security  ---> To control access for different user groups such as who can create, view, edit, or delete data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Difference between Canvas App and Model-Driven App?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1️⃣ Canvas Apps:
👉 Canvas Apps gives more flexibility control over the app layouts and i can design UI from scratch on a blank Canvas App. 
👉 We build apps using drag-and-drop components like buttons, galleries, forms and more.
👉 It easily connects to multiple data sources such as SharePoint, Excel, Dataverse, SQL, and more.

2️⃣ Model-Driven Apps:
👉 Model-driven apps are based on the data model in Dataverse.
👉 The UI is automatically generated based on tables, relationships, forms, and views defined in the data model.
👉 so we don’t have to design the UI manually like Canvas Apps.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Variables and types of Variables in power apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Variables are mainly used to store and manage data temporarily during app execution. 
👉 This data can hold different types such as numbers, strings, or booleans, depending on the situation.

🔹 Types of Variables:
1️⃣ Context Variables are Scoped only to the current screen.
💛 Syntax: UpdateContext({ VariableName: Value }) || Example: UpdateContext({ varName: "Manoj" })  

2️⃣ Global variables are accessible across multiple screens.
💛 Syntax: Set( VariableName, Value ) || Example: Set(varCountry, "India") 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Collections and types of Collections in power apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Collections are like group of information or data that used to store and manage multiple records temporarily during app runtime.

🔹 Types of Collections:
1. Collect() function: Creates a new collection or adds records to an existing one.
💛 Syntax: Collect(CollectionName, Record1, Record2, ...)
👉 Example: Collect(MyCollection, {Name: "Alice", Age: 25}) or using input controls like {Name: TextInput.Text, Age: Value(TextInput.Text)}

2. ClearCollect() function: Clears all existing records from a collection and adds a new records.
👉 Example: ClearCollect(MyCollection, {Name: "Alice1", Age: 20})

3. Clear() function: Removes all records from a collection.
👉 Example: Clear(MyCollection)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What are Components in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Components are reusable building blocks or custom controls that we can create once and we can use across multiple screens in the app.
👉 This helps to maintain consistency and reduces development effort across the app.
👉 Components have inputs and outputs properties, making them flexible and customizable based on the app’s needs.

✅ For Example: 
👉 A custom header or navigation menu built as a component can be reused across multiple screens in the app, ensuring consistent and making updates easier.
🔹 Component properties:
1️⃣ Input Property: Passes values or information into the component (e.g., user name, color choice).
2️⃣ Output Property: Sends data or triggers actions from inside the component (e.g., button click notification).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Cascading Dropdown in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 A Cascading Dropdown filter the options in one dropdown based on the selection made in another dropdown.
✅ For Example: when a user selects a country, only the cities related to that country appear in the second dropdown.

Dropdown 1 (Country) ---------> Items property: Distinct(CountriesCities, Country)
Dropdown 2 (City) ------------> Items property: Filter(CountriesCities, Country = Dropdown1.Selected.Result)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Explain the concept of Delgations in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Delegation means pushing data operations to the data source instead of bringing all the data into Power Apps.
👉 Power Apps has a default limit of 500 records (we can increase upto max 2000 records).
👉 When working with large datasets — for example, SharePoint lists with thousands of records.
👉 So using non-delegable functions can cause some incorrect data results.
👉 To problem slove this, we replaced non-delegable functions with delegable functions to handle data efficiently and correct data retrieval.
    ("Filter, Sort, and StartsWith")

👉 This approach improved app speed, ensured data accuracy and delivers a better user experience.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Validations in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Data validation means checking the user inputs to make sure the entered data must be in the correct or complete in the expected format,
    before it’s saving or processing them.
👉 This helps to prevent errors as well as improves overall the data quality.

✅ Power Apps offers built-in functions for Data Valadition:
IsBlank()  — checks if a field is empty.
IsMatch()  — validates patterns like emails or phone numbers.
IsNumeric() — confirms numeric inputs.
Notify()   — displays error messages to users.
Conditional formatting — like changing border colors or showing warnings based on input.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. What are connectors in power apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Connectors are pre-built components that power apps to communicate with external data sources or services.
🔹 There are two main types of Connectors:
1. Standard Connectors — connect to Microsoft services like SharePoint, Excel, Outlook, and OneDrive.
2. Premium Connectors  — provide access to advanced or third-party systems such as SQL Server, Salesforce.

👉 Using connectors helps to integrate external data easily without writing custom API's.

🔹 Creating a Custom Connector in Power Apps:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ To create a custom connector:
1. Navigate to Power Apps Portal > Data > Custom Connectors
2. Select New Custom Connector and choose a creation method (from blank, Postman file, or OpenAPI definition)
3. Define the connector’s name and description
4. Configure API authentication (No auth, Basic, OAuth 2.0, or API key). For secure APIs, OAuth 2.0 or API key is recommended
5. Define the connector’s actions and operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) matching the API endpoints
6. Test the connector thoroughly before integrating it into apps
7. This approach enables secure and reusable integration with external APIs beyond standard connectors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Difference between Gallery, Form and Data Table?

✅ GALLERY:
━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Gallery is a control that used to display and interact with multiple records from a data source like SharePoint.
👉 It support for dynamic layouts such as vertical, horizontal, and flexible-height galleries. 
👉 In gallery, Each item can be customized using labels, images, icons, and buttons to create interactive views for users.

✅ FORMS:
━━━━━━━━━
👉 Form is a control that used to view, create, and edit single record at a time from a connected data source.
🔹 There are three types of forms:
1. Display Form – for read-only data viewing.
2. Edit Form    – for editing existing records.
3. New Form     – for creating new records.
👉 Forms can automatically generate fields based on the selected data source and handle data binding and submission with minimal configuration.
👉 We can also customize field visibility, validation rules, and layout according to our needs.

✅ DATA TABLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Data Table is a control that used to display multiple records in a tabular format, similar to an Excel sheet.
👉 It is mainly used for READ-ONLY data, where users need review the data, sorting, and scanning across rows and columns.
👉 Data tables are automatically generates rows and columns based on the connected data source.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. How do you handle errors in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Error handling in Power Apps is mainly done using the IfError() function.
👉 It catches runtime errors during actions like data submissions or calculations, allowing me to show user-friendly messages and handle issues smoothly.

✅ For example:
👉 If a data submission fails, the IfError() function can display a clear message or trigger a fallback process,
    ensuring the app handles issues gracefully without crashing or confusing users.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Can you use Offline Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Apps supports offline Capabilities usage by storing data locally using Collections and combined with the SaveData() and LoadData() functions.
👉 When connectivity is restored, sync logic with functions like Patch() and Collect() updates the server with any offline changes. 

🔹 SaveData() function: saves data on the user’s device so the app can access it offline.
🔹 LoadData() function: retrieves saved data when the app starts or reconnects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. What are the limitations of Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔹 limitations of Power Apps:
1. Power Apps can retrieve only 500 to 2000 records from a data source unless delegation is managed properly.
2. Complex UI customization are limited, and app performance can slow down with too many controls.
3. Offline functionality requires manual implementation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14. What is the role of Environments in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Environments are isolated containers that used to manage apps, flows, connections, and Dataverse separately.
👉 It helps isolating data and apps for different teams or projects to work independently and securely.
✅ For Example:
👉 We can create seperately environments for development, testing, and production. Each environment can have its own data policies, permissions, and resources.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15. What are Containers in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Containers are layout controls used to group and align multiple controls together — like buttons, labels, inputs into one unit.
👉 They simplify responsive design by auto-adjust spacing, and maintaining consistent alignment across different screen sizes.
👉 Containers are especially useful for mobile-first designs or when handling dynamic screen sizes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. How do you create a Responsive Design in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 To create a responsive Design in Power Apps, I use container controls like vertical and horizontal containers based on the app’s needs.
👉 These containers automatically arrange the elements inside them based on the screen size.
👉 Instead of fixing each control’s size and position, I use formulas to adjust width and height relative to the screen.
✅ For Example:
👉 Uisng relative properities like "parent.width and parent.height" it helps to adjust their sizes and positions dynamically.

👉 This approach ensures the app looks good on any device — phone, tablet, or desktop.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17. What are the Role-Based Security in Power Apps. How do you manage them?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Apps security roles define what actions users can perform on data (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) and control access to apps, forms, and records.
👉 Security roles are managed in Microsoft Dataverse and we can be customized for individual users or groups.
👉 We can assign predefined security roles like (System Adminstrator, Environment Maker) or we can create custom roles based on business needs.

✅ For Example – Employee Management App:
🔹 Admin       → Full access to all records and Settings.
🔹 Manager     → Limited access to team-specific reports.
🔹 Employee    → Can only view and edit their own profile.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18. How do you manage version control and deployment (Solutions & ALM)?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 A Solution is a package that groups apps, flows, tables, components, and other resources together into one unit.
👉 It is mainly used for managing, moving, and deploying related components across different environments — like development, testing, and production.

✅ I follows ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) best practices using Solutions in Power Apps:

👉 I use Solutions in Power Apps to group related components like apps, flows, tables, and security roles into a single package together.
👉 During development, I use Unmanaged Solutions — these allow easy editing and collaboration.
👉 Once the app is tested and finalized, I export it as a Managed Solution for the Production environment.
    which are read-only to ensure stability and controlled updates.
👉 I also maintain separate environments for Dev, Test, and Prod.
👉 We move solutions across environments using Export/Import to maintain version control and ensure smooth deployment.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19. How do you use Power Apps in implement conditional formatting in your app?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Conditional formatting in Power Apps mainly through formulas on properties like Color, Fill, or Visible.
👉 Instead of hardcoding styles, I apply logic using If statements or Switch based on field values or user roles.

✅ Common use cases:
1. Change label or text color based on status: Color = If(ThisItem.Status = "Completed", Green, Red)
2. Highlight cards or controls when a condition is met: Fill = If(ThisItem.Score < 50, RGBA(255,0,0,0.1), White)
3. Show/hide fields depending on user role: Visible = If(User().Email = "admin@domain.com", true, false)
4. Disable controls until a required field is filled: DisplayMode = If(IsBlank(DataCardValue1.Text), DisplayMode.Disabled, DisplayMode.Edit)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20. Difference between configuration and customization?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Configuration means changing settings or using built-in tools to make the system work how you want, without any coding. 
    Like changing forms, adding fields, or creating filters.

👉 Customization means writing code or building new features to change how the system works, 
    like adding custom logic or integrating with other apps.

👉 So, configuration is easier and faster, and customization is for when you need something more advanced.
