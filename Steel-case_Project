✅ App 1: Inventory Management App – Responsive Canvas App
🎯 Purpose: "I developed a responsive Inventory Management App using Canvas App to help a client manage furniture stock across multiple warehouses."

🔧 Key Highlights:
📱 Responsive Design: Built using containers and relative positioning to auto-adjust across all devices desktop, tablet, and mobile.

🔧 Data Source: Used a SharePoint List (or Dataverse Table) named Inventory.
🗂️ Key columns included: ProductID, ProductName, Category, Quantity, WarehouseLocation.


🛠️ Canvas App Features I Built:
🏠 Home Screen:
– Gallery to display inventory Products, I customized each gallery item layouts.
– Added a Search box to find products by name.
– Add a Dropdowns to Filter() to allow users to filter by Category and Location.

➕ Add Item Screen:
– Added a “+” icon that opens a form for users to add new products.
– Used SubmitForm() to save data into SharePoint.

ℹ️ Item Details Screen:
– On selecting a gallery item, → Navigate to a screen to display full item details (eg., Product name, Quantity, Category, Location).
– They can view all details in read-only mode.
– I enabled editing using EditForm control for authorized users.

🔴 Low Stock Alerts:
– I also added a Low Stock Warning — if Quantity < 5, it shows a red icon to alert users.

5️⃣ Warehouse View:
– Used GroupBy() to group inventory by warehouse
– Displayed total quantity per warehouse for better planning.


📈 Finally Impact:
------------------
🎯 …………This app helped the client replace manual stock tracking with a digital system…………
— Earlier they were tracking inventory manually in Excel, manual methods to track inventory,
— now with the canvas app, all records are digital, stored in SharePoint, and easily accessible.

🎯 …………Reduced errors…………
— Since the app uses structured forms with validation and direct integration with SharePoint.
— it reduced Manual data entry mistakes like duplicate items, wrong quantities, or missing fields.

🎯 …………Improved warehouse visibility…………
— Warehouse staff can now quickly search or filter stock based on category or location and see accurate, real-time availability
— something not possible with manual tracking

🎯 …………Saved time for the operations team…………
— With this app, the team saved a lot of time — they no longer had to search through Excel or call each location. 
— Everything was centralized and quick to update or access.

🗂️ Key Columns:

🔢 PO_ID (Text)
🏭 VendorName (Text)
📦 ItemOrdered (Text)
📅 OrderDate, DeliveryDate (DateTime)
📌 Status (Choice: Pending, In-Transit, Delivered)
🔢 QuantityOrdered (Number)


🛠️ Canvas App Features I Built:

1️⃣ Dashboard Screen:
🖼️ Created a Gallery to list all orders
🎨 Conditional formatting:
🟡 Yellow = Pending
🔵 Blue = In-Transit
✅ Green = Delivered

🔍 Search & Filter:
👉 Dropdown to filter by Status
👉 Date Picker to filter by OrderDate range

2️⃣ Order Details Screen:

✏️ Added Edit button to update status
💡 Used Patch() to update data directly to SharePoint/Dataverse

3️⃣ Add New Purchase Order:

🧠 Extra Logic Used:
🧮 Used Filter() + Search() for optimized querying
🚫 Handled delegation warnings to support large data
🔐 Applied role-based access with User().Email logic (e.g., only procurement users can edit)


📈 Impact:
📉 Eliminated manual Excel/email-based tracking
🕒 Enabled real-time order visibility across teams
📲 Provided mobile-ready access for tracking & status updates
🤝 Improved vendor coordination and delivery planning










🔥 Improved Interview Answer: Inventory App

"Yes, I’ve built and developed a fully responsive Inventory Management App using Canvas App. 
The purpose was to help the client track furniture stock across multiple warehouse locations."

📦 Here’s how I built it:
I started by creating a SharePoint list named Inventory, which included columns like ID, Product Name, Quantity, Category, and Location.
Then I connected this list to my Canvas App, where I designed two main screens:

Home Screen – to view, search, and filter inventory.

Details Screen – to display full item details and allow editing.

🎯 Key Features I Implemented:
On the Home Screen, I used a Gallery control to show all inventory items.

I customized each gallery item layout.

Added a Search box to find products by name.

Used Filter() to allow users to filter by Category and Location.


Added a “+” icon that opens a form for users to add new products.

Used SubmitForm() to save data back to SharePoint.


On selecting a gallery item, users are taken to the Details Screen, where:

They can view all details in read-only mode.

I enabled editing using EditForm control for authorized users.

I also added a Low Stock Warning — if Quantity < 5, it shows a red icon to alert users.


💡 Additional Value:
The app is responsive — built with containers and flexible layouts so it works across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

✅ Impact:
"Earlier they were tracking inventory manually in Excel — now with the app, all records are digital, stored in SharePoint, and easily accessible."

"Since the app uses structured forms and direct integration with SharePoint, it reduced data entry mistakes and ensured cleaner, more accurate records."

"Warehouse staff can now quickly search or filter stock based on category or location and see accurate, real-time availability
— something not possible with manual tracking

"With this app, the team saved a lot of time — they no longer had to search through Excel or call each location. 
Everything was centralized and quick to update or access.
