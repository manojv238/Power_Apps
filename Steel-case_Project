✅ App 1: Inventory Management App
🎯 Purpose: Yes, I’ve built an Inventory Management App for a client to track and manage their furniture stock across multiple warehouses.

🔧 Data Source: Used a SharePoint List (or Dataverse Table) named Inventory.
🗂️ Key columns included:

📦 ItemID (Text)
🪑 ItemName (Text)
🏷️ Category (Choice)
📊 QuantityAvailable (Number)
📍 WarehouseLocation (Choice/Text)
🕒 LastUpdated (DateTime)


🛠️ Canvas App Features I Built:

1️⃣ Home Screen:
🖼️ Gallery to display inventory items
🔍 Search box to filter by Item Name
📂 Dropdowns to filter by Category and WarehouseLocation

2️⃣ Item Details Screen:
📋 On selecting an inventory item → Navigate to a screen showing: Name, Quantity, Category, Location.

3️⃣ Add New Item:
➕ Used a Form Control for admins to add new items
💾 Used SubmitForm() to save into SharePoint or Dataverse

4️⃣ Low Stock Alerts:
🔴 Added Red Icon/Label if QuantityAvailable < 5...

5️⃣ Warehouse View:
🏭 Used GroupBy() to group inventory by warehouse
📈 Displayed total quantity per warehouse for better planning


🧠 Logic Highlights:
👉 Used If() and Switch() for conditional UI rendering
👉 Applied Sort(), Filter(), and GroupBy() for dynamic data manipulation
👉 Managed delegation for performance with SharePoint


📈 Impact:
🔔 Reduced stock-out incidents by flagging low inventory in real-time.
🏭 Gave warehouse managers a clear and grouped view of stock per location.
📱 Enabled mobile access for staff to track, update, and view inventory on the go.

✅ App 2: Purchase Order Tracking App
🎯 Purpose: To help the procurement team track vendor orders, delivery timelines, and statuses in real-time — reducing delays and improving efficiency.

🔧 Data Source: Used a SharePoint List (or Dataverse Table) named 📄 PurchaseOrders
🗂️ Key Columns:

🔢 PO_ID (Text)
🏭 VendorName (Text)
📦 ItemOrdered (Text)
📅 OrderDate, DeliveryDate (DateTime)
📌 Status (Choice: Pending, In-Transit, Delivered)
🔢 QuantityOrdered (Number)


🛠️ Canvas App Features I Built:

1️⃣ Dashboard Screen:
🖼️ Created a Gallery to list all orders
🎨 Conditional formatting:
🟡 Yellow = Pending
🔵 Blue = In-Transit
✅ Green = Delivered

🔍 Search & Filter:
👉 Dropdown to filter by Status
👉 Date Picker to filter by OrderDate range

2️⃣ Order Details Screen:
📋 On selecting a record → navigate to a detailed screen
✏️ Added Edit button to update status
💡 Used Patch() to update data directly to SharePoint/Dataverse

3️⃣ Add New Purchase Order:
➕ Created a Form Screen to add new orders
📨 Used SubmitForm() to save data
✅ OnSuccess → showed a toast message and navigated back to Dashboard


🧠 Extra Logic Used:
🧮 Used Filter() + Search() for optimized querying
🚫 Handled delegation warnings to support large data
🔐 Applied role-based access with User().Email logic (e.g., only procurement users can edit)


📈 Impact:
📉 Eliminated manual Excel/email-based tracking
🕒 Enabled real-time order visibility across teams
📲 Provided mobile-ready access for tracking & status updates
🤝 Improved vendor coordination and delivery planning
