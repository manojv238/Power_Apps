Here's a practical how you built the "INVENTORY MANAGEMENT APP" — clear, concise, and interview-ready:


✅ App 1: Inventory Management App
🎯 Purpose: To track furniture stock and ensure optimal asset availability across all warehouses(locations).

🔧 Data Source: Used a SharePoint List (or Dataverse Table) named Inventory.

Key columns:

📦 ItemID (Text)
🪑 ItemName (Text)
🏷️ Category (Choice)
📊 QuantityAvailable (Number)
📍 WarehouseLocation (Choice/Text)
🕒 LastUpdated (DateTime)


🛠️ Canvas App Features I Built:

1️⃣ Home Screen:
🖼️ Gallery to display inventory items
🔍 Search box to filter by Item Name
📂 Dropdowns to filter by Category and WarehouseLocation

2️⃣ Item Details Screen:
📋 On selecting an inventory item → Navigate to a screen showing: Name, Quantity, Category, Location.

3️⃣ Add New Item:
➕ Used a Form Control for admins to add new items
💾 Used SubmitForm() to save into SharePoint or Dataverse

4️⃣ Low Stock Alerts:
🔴 Added Red Icon/Label if QuantityAvailable < 5

5️⃣ Warehouse View:
🏭 Used GroupBy() to group inventory by warehouse
📈 Displayed total quantity per warehouse for better planning


🧠 Logic Highlights:
Used If() and Switch() for conditional UI rendering
Applied Sort(), Filter(), and GroupBy() for dynamic data manipulation
Managed delegation for performance with SharePoint


✅ Impact:
Reduced stock-out incidents by flagging low inventory early 🔔
Helped warehouse managers with a clear view of stock distribution
Enabled mobile access to real-time inventory 📱







Perfect! 
Here's how you can explain the Purchase Order Tracking App in an interview-ready, practical way — showing your hands-on Power Apps skills, logic, and impact:

✅ App 2: Purchase Order Tracking App.
Purpose:
To help the procurement team easily track vendor orders, delivery dates, and order statuses in real time.

🔧 Data Source:
I used a SharePoint List (or Dataverse Table) named PurchaseOrders.

Key columns included:

PO_ID, VendorName, ItemOrdered, OrderDate, DeliveryDate, Status (Choice), and QuantityOrdered.

🛠️ Canvas App Features I Built:
1. Dashboard Screen
Designed a Gallery to show all purchase orders.

Used conditional formatting to highlight rows by status:

Yellow for Pending

Blue for In-Transit

Green for Delivered

Enabled quick search and filter using a Dropdown (for Status) and Date Picker (for Order Date range).

2. Order Details Screen
When an order is selected, navigated to a detail screen showing full order info.

Added an Edit button with a form to update the status (e.g., when the order gets delivered).

Used the Patch() function to update the SharePoint/Dataverse record.

3. Add New Purchase Order
Created a Form Screen for new order entry.

Used OnSuccess to show a toast message and navigate back to the Dashboard.

Used SubmitForm() to save the new entry to SharePoint/Dataverse.

🧠 Extra Logic Used:
Implemented filtering using Filter() and Search() functions for better performance.

Handled delegation for large datasets.

Applied role-based visibility using User().Email logic for procurement-specific actions.

✅ Impact:
Reduced manual tracking via Excel/email.

Gave the team real-time visibility into delivery delays.

Improved vendor follow-ups with live status tracking from mobile and desktop.
