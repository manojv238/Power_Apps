Hi [Interviewer’s Name], good morning. 
First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity.

My name is Manoj Kumar, and I’m from Tirupati. I completed my graduation in B.Sc. Computer Science from S.V. University, Tirupati.

I have around 2 years of experience as a Power Apps Developer in my current organization, I have worked on multiple projects from scratch,
— Primarily focusing on Canvas Apps development and integrate with SharePoint as the backend Data source. 
— I’ve also used Power Automate to build automated workflows for approvals, notifications, and other automation tasks.

I’ve worked on two major projects — one for Steelcase and another for Herbalife, both are US-based clients.


🔹 Roles & Responsibilities:
-------------------------------
Firstly:
– I started by understanding business requirements — like what users needed and expected from the application.

– I designed the UI and developed Canvas Apps from scratch, its aligning with client needs and use cases.

– I used SharePoint as the backend data source to store and manage data. 
– I connected the app to SharePoint lists and implemented full CRUD operations using Power Fx functions like Patch(), Remove(), and Collect().

– I worked with various controls such as galleries, forms, dropdowns, buttons, Icons, and customized them as per the business logic.

– I focused on designing a responsive UI/UX, ensuring the app was both professional and user-friendly across all devices.

– Once the development was complete, I conducted end-to-end testing covering all data and UI scenarios.

– I shared the app with stakeholders, gathered feedback for UI improvements, validations, and business logic enhancements, and refined the app accordingly.

– Finally, I published the app and configured proper role-based permissions to ensure secure access.

Overall, with hands-on experience in Canvas App development, integration with SharePoint, Power Fx customization, and workflow automation. 
I’m confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team and deliver high-quality solutions.
