Hi [Interviewerâ€™s Name], good morning. First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity.

My name is Manoj Kumar, and Iâ€™m from Tirupati. I completed my graduation in B.Sc. Computer Science from S.V. University, Tirupati.

I have around 2 years of experience as a Power Apps Developer in my current organization, where I worked on multiple projects from scratch
especially i'm focusing on Canvas Apps development and using SharePoint as the backend Data source.

I have completed two major projects â€”one for Steelcase and another for Herbalife, both US-based clients.


ðŸ”¹ Roles & Responsibilities:
-------------------------------
Firstly, I can understood the business requirements â€” like what exactly the users needed, what users expected from the app.

I can Designed UI and built Canvas Apps from scratch based on the business requirements or clientâ€™s needs.

So I Used SharePoint Online as a backend Data Source to store and manage all the data information.
and I connected my app to SharePoint lists and handled CRUD operations ntg but â€”like creating records, review a recrods, updating records, and deleting records,
Similarly using Power Fx functions like Patch(), Remove(), and Collect().

And i Worked with various controls such as galleries, forms, buttons, dropdowns, and customized each control based on the specific bussiness use cases.

So I can Built dynamic form features â€”for example, allowing users to add multiple experience entries using Collections like Collect() and ClearCollect().

And Applied data validation using functions like IsMatch() and IsBlank() to improve accuracy and user input quality.

So i can Designed a responsive UI/UX Ideas, focusing on making app professional, and a user-friendly experience across all devices.

During app development, I frequently use several Power Fx functions like:
Filter() and LookUp() ---> to show filtered and specific data,
Navigate() --------------> for smooth transitions between screens,
User() ------------------> to personalize content based on the logged-in user.

Once the app development was completed, I personally handled the testing phase to ensure everything worked as expected across all screens and data scenarios.

After internal validation, I shared the app with stakeholders for feedback. I received valuable inputs regarding both UI and user flow, 
based on that I made refinements to the layouts, logics, and validations to improve the user experience.

Once everything was finalized, I published the app and assigned proper permissions for users, which helped to automate manual tasks and reduce errors and save time.

Overall, with my experience in Canvas Apps development and integration with SharePoint,
Iâ€™m confident in my ability to add value and contribute for the growth of your organization.
