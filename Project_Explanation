Hi [Interviewer’s Name], good morning. First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity.

My name is Manoj Kumar, and I’m from Tirupati. I completed my graduation in B.Sc. Computer Science from S.V. University, Tirupati.

I have around 2 years of experience as a Power Apps Developer in my current organization, where I worked on multiple projects from scratch
especially focusing on Canvas Apps development and using SharePoint as the backend Data source.

I have completed two major projects —one for Steelcase and another for Herbalife, both US-based clients.


🔹 Roles & Responsibilities:
-------------------------------
Firstly, I can understood the business requirements — like what exactly the users needed, what users expected from the app.

Designed UI and built Canvas Apps from scratch based on the business requirements or client’s needs.

Used SharePoint Online as a backend Data Source to store and manage all the data.
I connected my app to SharePoint lists and handled CRUD operations —like creating records, updating records, and deleting records,
using Power Fx functions like Patch(), Remove(), and Collect().

Worked with various controls such as galleries, forms, buttons, dropdowns, and customized each control based on the specific bussiness use cases.

Built dynamic form features —for example, allowing users to add multiple experience entries using Collections like Collect() and ClearCollect().

Applied data validation using functions like IsMatch() and IsBlank() to improve accuracy and user input quality.

Designed a clean and responsive UI/UX, focusing on making app professional, and a user-friendly experience across all devices.

During app development, I frequently use several Power Fx functions like:
Filter() and LookUp() ---> to show filtered and specific data,
Navigate() --------------> for smooth transitions between screens,
User() ------------------> to personalize content based on the logged-in user.

After development, I handled testing, gathered stakeholder feedback, and made improvements accordingly.

Once finalized, I published and shared the app with the team, which helped automate manual tasks, reduce errors, and save time.

Overall, with my experience in Canvas App development, SharePoint integration, and Power Fx customization,
I’m confident in my ability to add value and contribute for the growth of your organization.
