1. What is Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Automate is a cloud-based service by Microsoft designed to automate repetitive tasks and processes.
👉 It allows users to create automate workflows that connect with various apps and services.
👉 With Power Automate, Users can automate tasks like sending notifications, managing approval processes, syncing files without needed advanced coding skills.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. What are the different types of flows in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Power Automate supports five main types of flows:

🔹 1. Automated Flow:
👉 Triggered automatically by specific event or condition.
👉 For Example, when a new item is added to a SharePoint list, an email is received in Outlook, or a file is created in OneDrive.

🔹 2. Instant Flow (Button Flow):
👉 Manually triggered by users, typically through a button press. (in Power Apps or the Power Automate mobile app).
👉 It allows users to start actions on demand, such as sending approvals, sending notifications.

🔹 3. Scheduled Flow:
👉 Runs on a define schedule — (e.g., daily, weekly, hourly) — to automate repetitive tasks.
👉 For Example, Automatically generate and email a report every Monday at 9 AM.

🔹 4. Business Process Flow (BPF):
👉 Used in Model-Driven Apps to guide users through a multi-step business process.

🔹 5. Desktop Flow (RPA):
👉 Used for Robotic Process Automation(RPA) to automate manual tasks on desktop (e.g., legacy systems).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. What are Trigger and Action in Power Automate?

🔹 Trigger:
👉 A Trigger is the starting point of any flow — it defines the event that initiates the workflow.
👉 I’ve used various triggers like:
— When an item is created in SharePoint
— When an email arrives in Outlook

🔹 Action:
👉 An Action is the response or task performed after the trigger runs.
👉 Examples of actions I’ve used:
— Send an approval email
— Update a SharePoint item
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. What is the purpose of Conditions in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Conditions in Power Automate are used to create logic-based decision branches, 
   — meaning the flow can take different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.

🔧 Example (Real-time use): 
👉 In one of my flows, I used a Condition to check if a SharePoint item’s status is "Pending".
If Approved(true):
👉 Update the SharePoint item status to "Approved"
👉 Send an Outlook email to employee with subject: “Leave Request Approved”

If Rejected(false):
👉 Update status to "Rejected"
👉 Send rejection email to the employee
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What is Parallel branching in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Parallel branching allows you to run multiple actions simultaneously — instead of executing them one after another.

🔧 Example (Real-time use): 
👉 In one of my workflows, after a form submission, I configured parallel branches to:
— Send a confirmation email to the user
— Update a SharePoint list with form details
— Notify the team in Microsoft Teams
👉 All these actions ran simultaneously, improving performance and reducing wait time compared to step-by-step execution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. What is a Scope in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Scope is like a container control in Power Automate that is used to group multiple actions together.
👉 It helps in organizing flows and especially useful for error handling, debugging, and logical separation of actions.

🔧 For Example:
👉 I use Scopes to grouped all the main actions — like creating a record, sending an email, and updating SharePoint — inside a Scope called ‘Try’.
👉 One key benefit is that I can apply ‘Configure Run After’ logic to an entire Scope.
🔹 For example:
— I have a ‘Main Actions’ scope that performs all business logic
— Then a second ‘Error Handling’ scope that only runs if the first scope fails
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. How can you handle errors in Power Automate flows?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 In Power Automate, I handle errors using a combination of Configure Run After, Scope controls, and error-handling actions, 
    — like sending notifications or logging failures.

👉 I usually wrap critical steps inside a Scope block — for example, actions related to updating a SharePoint list or calling an API.
👉 Then I use another Scope called ‘Error Handling’, and configure it to run only if the previous scope fails using the 'Configure Run After → has failed' option.
👉 Inside the error scope, I typically:
📧 Send an email alert to the admin or support team.
📝 Log the error message using a Compose or Append to Array step.
🔁 Sometimes use Retry Policies for temporary issues like timeout or throttling.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. What are Expressions in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Expressions in Power Automate are used to manipulate data, perform calculations, format values, and apply logic within the flow.

✅ I commonly use expressions for tasks like:
— Formatting dates: formatDateTime(triggerOutputs()?['headers']['x-ms-file-last-modified'], 'yyyy-MM-dd')
— String manipulation: concat(), replace(), substring()
— Null checks: if(empty(...), 'Default', 'Value')
— Mathematical operations: add(), div(), mod()
.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Describe a flow you have built end-to-end? Have you used approval flows? How did you implement them?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Yes, I have built several approval flows using Power Automate — here's one real-time example:

🔷 Business Use Case: Automate employee leave request approval process using SharePoint and Power Automate.

🔹 Step 1 – SharePoint List:
👉 I created a SharePoint Online list called Leave Requests with columns like:
Employee Name
Leave Type
Start Date
End Date
Manager
Status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
Comments

🔹 Step 2 – Trigger in Power Automate:
👉 Created an automated cloud flow with the trigger:

🟢 "When an item is created" in the Leave Requests SharePoint list.

🔹 Step 3 – Get Manager Email:
👉 Used the "Get user profile (V2)" action from Microsoft 365 to fetch the manager's email dynamically from the selected Manager field.

🔹 Step 4 – Start Approval:
👉 Used the "Start and wait for an approval" action (Type: Approve/Reject – First to respond).
👉 Assigned to the Manager's email.
👉 Included dynamic content: employee name, leave type, duration.

🔹 Step 5 – Condition Check:
👉 Added a Condition control to check the outcome of the approval:

If Approved:
👉 Update the SharePoint item status to "Approved"
👉 Send an Outlook email to employee with subject: “Leave Request Approved”

If Rejected:
👉 Update status to "Rejected"
👉 Send rejection email to the employee
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. What is Concurrency Control in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Concurrency Control helps you manage how many simultaneous (parallel) flow runs can happen at the same time. 
   — especially important when working with loops (Apply to each).

🔹 Why It's Needed:
👉 When a loop processes many items (e.g., SharePoint list items, array values), Power Automate runs iterations in parallel by default.
🔹 This can:
👉 Improve performance ✅
👉 But also cause data conflicts, race conditions ❌ (e.g., when updating same record or sending multiple dependent actions)

🔧 How to Enable/Disable:
👉 In your flow, go to "Apply to each" → Click ellipsis (...)
👉 Choose "Settings"
👉 You'll see a setting:
🔘 Concurrency Control → Turn it On
👉 Set Degree of Parallelism (e.g., 1 to 50)
