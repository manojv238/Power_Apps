1. What is Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Automate is a cloud-based service by Microsoft designed to automate repetitive tasks and processes.
👉 It allows users to create automate workflows that connect with various apps and services.
👉 With Power Automate, Users can automate tasks like sending email notifications, managing approval processes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. What are the different types of flows in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Power Automate supports five main types of flows:

🔹 1. Automated Flow:
👉 Triggered automatically by specific event or condition.
👉 For Example, when a new item is added to a SharePoint list, an email is received in Outlook, or a file is created in OneDrive.

🔹 2. Instant Flow (Button Flow):
👉 Manually triggered by users, typically through a button press. (in Power Apps or the Power Automate mobile app).
👉 It allows users to start actions on demand, such as sending approvals, sending notifications.

🔹 3. Scheduled Flow:
👉 Runs on a define schedule — (e.g., daily, weekly, hourly) — to automate repetitive tasks.
👉 For Example, Automatically generate and email a report every Monday at 9 AM.

🔹 4. Business Process Flow (BPF):
👉 Used in Model-Driven Apps to guide users through a multi-step business process.

🔹 5. Desktop Flow (RPA):
👉 Used for Robotic Process Automation(RPA) to automate manual tasks on desktop (e.g., legacy systems).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. What are Trigger and Action in Power Automate?

🔹 Trigger:
👉 A Trigger is the starting point of any flow — it defines the event that initiates the workflow.
👉 Examples of triggers I’ve used:
— When an item is created in SharePoint
— When an email arrives in Outlook

🔹 Action:
👉 An Action is the response or task performed after the trigger runs.
👉 Examples of actions I’ve used:
— Send an approval email
— Update a SharePoint item
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. What is the purpose of Conditions in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Conditions in Power Automate are used to create logic-based decision branches, 
   — meaning the flow can take different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.

🔧 Example (Real-time use): 
👉 In one of my flows, I used a Condition to check if a SharePoint item’s status is "Pending".
If Approved(true):
👉 Update the SharePoint item status to "Approved"
👉 Send an Outlook email to employee with subject: “Leave Request Approved”

If Rejected(false):
👉 Update status to "Rejected"
👉 Send rejection email to the employee
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What is Parallel branching in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Parallel branching allows you to run multiple actions simultaneously — instead of executing them one after another.

🔧 Example (Real-time use): 
👉 In one of my workflows, after a form submission, I configured parallel branches to:
— Send a confirmation email to the user
— Update a SharePoint list with form details
— Notify the team in Microsoft Teams
👉 All these actions ran simultaneously, improving performance and reducing wait time compared to step-by-step execution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. What is a Scope in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Scope is like a container control in Power Automate that is used to group multiple actions together.
👉 It helps in organizing flows and especially useful for error handling, debugging, and logical separation of actions.

🔧 For Example:
👉 I use Scopes to grouped all the main actions — like creating a record, sending an email, and updating SharePoint — inside a Scope called ‘Try’.
👉 One key benefit is that I can apply ‘Configure Run After’ logic to an entire Scope.
🔹 For example:
— I have a ‘Main Actions’ scope that performs all business logic
— Then a second ‘Error Handling’ scope that only runs if the first scope fails
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. How can you handle errors in Power Automate flows?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉"In Power Automate,
I handle errors using a combination of Configure Run After, Scope actions, and proper error logging.
For example, I usually create separate scopes like Try, Catch, and Finally. 
In the Try scope, I place the main logic of the flow, and
in the Catch scope, I configure it to run only if the Try scope fails using the 'Configure Run After' option.(Has Failed,Is Skipped, Has timeout) 

Inside the Catch scope, I log the error details in SharePoint or Dataverse and send a failure notification email to the support team so they are aware of the issue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. What are Expressions in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Expressions in Power Automate are used to manipulate data, perform calculations, format values, and apply logic within the flow.

✅ I commonly use expressions for tasks like:
— Formatting dates: formatDateTime(triggerOutputs()?['headers']['x-ms-file-last-modified'], 'yyyy-MM-dd')
— String manipulation: concat(), replace(), substring()
— Null checks: if(empty(...), 'Default', 'Value')
— Mathematical operations: add(), div(), mod()
.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Describe a flow you have built end-to-end? Have you used approval flows? How did you implement them?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Yes, I have built several approval flows using Power Automate — here's one real-time example:

"In my project, I implemented an approval flow using Power Automate integrated with Dataverse and Power Apps. 
First, I created a Dataverse table to store purchase order details such as employee name, order information, manager, and status. 
Then I created an automated cloud flow with the trigger 'When a row is added' in Dataverse.
Whenever a new order was created from Power Apps, the flow was triggered automatically. 
After that, I used the 'Get user profile (V2)' action to fetch the manager’s email dynamically.
I used the 'Start and wait for an approval' action to send the approval request to the manager with all the order details.
Once the manager approved or rejected the request, 
I add "Update item "action for SP & Dataverse .
I used a condition to check the outcome and updated the status in the Dataverse table accordingly. 
I also sent email notifications to the employee informing them about the approval or rejection.

# 5 Types of Approvals:
1. Approve/Reject – First to respond
2. Approve/Reject – Everyone must approve
3. Custom Responses – Wait for one response
4. Custom Responses – Wait for all responses

✅ How to send an Reminder emails using approvals:

"To achieve reminder emails for pending approvals, I implement it using Power Automate with parallel branch and delay functionality. 
After the 'Start and wait for an approval' action, 
I add a parallel branch. 
In one branch, the flow waits for the approval response, and in the other branch, I use a 'Delay' action for 3 days.

After the delay, I add a condition to check the approval status. 
If the approval is still pending, I send a reminder email to the manager using the 'Send an email (V2)' action. 
If the approval is already completed, the reminder email is not sent.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. What is Concurrency Control in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Concurrency Control helps you manage how many simultaneous (parallel) flow runs can happen at the same time. 
   — especially important when working with loops (Apply to each).

🔹 Why It's Needed:
👉 When a loop processes many items (e.g., SharePoint list items, array values), Power Automate runs iterations in parallel by default.
🔹 This can:
👉 Improve performance ✅
👉 But also cause data conflicts, race conditions ❌ (e.g., when updating same record or sending multiple dependent actions)

🔧 How to Enable/Disable:
👉 In your flow, go to "Apply to each" → Click ellipsis (...)
👉 Choose "Settings"
👉 You'll see a setting:
🔘 Concurrency Control → Turn it On
👉 Set Degree of Parallelism (e.g., 1 to 50)
