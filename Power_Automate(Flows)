1. What is Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Automate is a cloud-based service that helps to automate workflows across different apps and services — without writing much code.
👉 It allows users to create automated workflows by connectiong different "triggers and actions".
   – such as a sending notifications or managing approval processes and syncing data across platforms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. What are the different types of flows in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
There are theree main types of flows:
1. Cloud flows:
2. Desktop flows: 
👉 Used for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate tasks on desktop apps or legacy systems that don't have APIs.
👉 Tool: Built using Power Automate Desktop.

3. Business process flows: 
👉 Guides users through defined steps in a business process inside Model-Driven Apps/Dataverse.
👉 Tool: Configured in Power Apps using BPF designer.

1. AUTOMATED FLOW: 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Triggered automatically by specific events or conditions.
👉 For Example, when a new item is added to a SharePoint list, an email is received, or a file is created in OneDrive,
    the flow runs automatically to perform predefined actions.

2. INSTANT FLOW: 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Manually triggered by users, typically through a button press. (in Power Apps or the Power Automate mobile app).
👉 It allows users to start actions on demand, such as sending approvals, notifications, or triggering a process when needed.

3. SCHEDULED FLOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Runs at a set schedule — like daily, weekly, or monthly — to automate repetitive tasks.
👉 For Example, such as generating reports, data synchronization, or system cleanups.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. What are Triggers and Actions in Power Automate?

TRIGGERS:
━━━━━━━━━
👉 A Trigger is the starting point of any flow — it defines the event that initiates the workflow.
👉 I’ve used various triggers like — like When an item is created in SharePoint, When an email arrives in Outlook, etc.

ACTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━
👉 An Action is the step that gets executed after a trigger fires. ("Each flow can have multiple actions")
👉 It’s what the flow actually does — like sending an email, updating records, creating files, etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. What is the purpose of Conditions in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Conditions in Power Automate allow flows to execute specific actions based on logic criteria.
🔹 For example:
👉 In a leave approval process, I set a condition to check if the leave days are more than 5. If yes, the approval goes to the senior manager; if no, it goes to the team lead. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What is Parallel branching in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Parallel branching to run multiple actions or sets of actions at the same time within a flow.

🔹 For example, in one workflow, after a form submission, I set up parallel branches to:
👉 Send a confirmation email, Update a SharePoint list, and Notify the team in Teams.
👉 All these actions ran simultaneously, improving performance and reducing wait time compared to step-by-step execution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. What is a Scope in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 A Scope is like a container in Power Automate that groups multiple actions together. I use it mainly for organizing flows and implementing error handling.

🔹 For example, 
👉 One of my flows, I grouped all the main actions — like creating a record, sending an email, and updating SharePoint — inside a Scope called ‘Try’.
👉 Then I added a separate ‘Catch’ Scope, which runs only if the Try Scope fails (using Configure Run After).
👉 This way, I could log the error and send a Teams alert without stopping the flow.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. How can you handle Errors in Power Automate flows?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔹 I usually handle errors in Power Automate flows using:
👉 Configure Run After ---> I use this to run specific actions only when the previous one fails, is skipped, or times out.
👉 Scope with Try-Catch Pattern ---> I wrap actions in a Scope block (Try), and if anything fails, the Catch scope handles logging or sending alerts.
👉 Terminate Action ---> I use this to end a flow with a custom status (Succeeded, Failed, Cancelled).
👉 Send Notifications ---> If something goes wrong, I trigger an email or Teams message to inform the relevant team.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. What are Expressions in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Expressions in Power Automate are used to manipulate data and add logic inside a flow. I use them when I need more control than basic actions can provide.

👉 For example, I’ve used expressions like formatDateTime() to format dates,
👉 if() to apply conditional logic inside actions,
👉 and length() to check if a list or array has items before proceeding.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Describe a flow you have built end-to-end: Have you used approval flows? How did you implement them?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Yes, I built an end-to-end leave approval workflow using Power Automate integrated with SharePoint, Outlook.

🔹 Step 1 – Trigger: 
👉 The process starts when a new leave request is submitted to a SharePoint list.

🔹 Step 2 – Flow Triggered: 
👉 A Power Automate flow is triggered automatically when a new item is created in the SharePoint list.

🔹 Step 3 – Condition Check: 
👉 I added a condition to check if the leave days are more than 5.
👉 If it's more than 5, the request goes to the senior manager for approval.
👉 Otherwise, it goes to the team lead.

🔹 Step 4 – Approval Process: 
👉 I used the Start and Wait for an Approval action. Based on the response: I updated the SharePoint item status.
👉 If approved, the SharePoint list is updated with the new status.
👉 If rejected, the flow updates the status and sends a rejection message.

🔹 Step 5 – Notifications: 
👉 The flow sends an email via Outlook and a Teams message to notify the employee about the outcome.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. What is Concurrency Control in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Concurrency Control is used to manage how many flow runs happen in parallel when looping through items — especially in actions like "Apply to Each."

🔹 How I used it: In one flow, I was processing SharePoint list items and sending emails. 
👉 Initially, Power Automate ran all iterations in parallel, which caused issues — like Rate limits ⛔ and Sending emails out of order 📬.
👉 So, I turned on Concurrency Control, set the degree of parallelism to 1, and ensured that actions ran one at a time in sequence ✅
