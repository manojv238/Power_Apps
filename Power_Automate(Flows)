1. What is Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Automate is a cloud-based service by Microsoft designed to automate repetitive tasks and processes.
👉 It allows users to create automate workflows that connect with various apps and services.
👉 With Power Automate, Users can automate tasks like sending notifications, managing approval processes, syncing files without needed advanced coding skills.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. What are the different types of flows in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Power Automate supports five main types of flows:

🔹 1. Automated Flow:
👉 Triggered automatically by specific event or condition.
👉 For Example, when a new item is added to a SharePoint list, an email is received, or a file is created in OneDrive.

🔹 2. Instant Flow (Button Flow):
👉 Manually triggered by users, typically through a button press. (in Power Apps or the Power Automate mobile app).
👉 It allows users to start actions on demand, such as sending approvals, sending notifications.

🔹 3. Scheduled Flow:
👉 Runs on a define schedule — (e.g., daily, weekly, hourly) — to automate repetitive tasks.
👉 For Example, Automatically generate and email a report every Monday at 9 AM.

🔹 4. Business Process Flow (BPF):
👉 Used in Model-Driven Apps to guide users through a multi-step business process.

🔹 5. Desktop Flow (RPA):
👉 Used for Robotic Process Automation(RPA) to automate manual tasks on desktop (e.g., legacy systems).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. What are Trigger and Action in Power Automate?

🔹 Trigger:
👉 A Trigger is the starting point of any flow — it defines the event that initiates the workflow.
👉 I’ve used various triggers like:
— When an item is created in SharePoint
— When an email arrives in Outlook

🔹 Action:
👉 An Action is the response or task performed after the trigger runs.
👉 Examples of actions I’ve used:
— Send an approval email
— Update a SharePoint item
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. What is the purpose of Conditions in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Conditions are used to add logic and decision-making in a flow.
👉 It allow the flow to branch based on whether a condition is true or false — just like IF statements in programming.

🔧 Example (Real-time use): 
👉 In one of my flows, I used a Condition to check if a SharePoint item’s status is "Pending".
🔹 If true, the flow sends an approval email.
🔹 If false, it skips approval and just logs the data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What is Parallel branching in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Parallel branching allows you to run multiple actions simultaneously — instead of executing them one after another.

🔧 Example (Real-time use): 
👉 In one of my workflows, after a form submission, I configured parallel branches to:
— Send a confirmation email to the user
— Update a SharePoint list with form details
— Notify the team in Microsoft Teams
🔹 All these actions ran simultaneously, improving performance and reducing wait time compared to step-by-step execution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. What is a Scope in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 A Scope is like a container in Power Automate that groups multiple actions together. I use it mainly for organizing flows and implementing error handling.

🔹 For example, 
👉 One of my flows, I grouped all the main actions — like creating a record, sending an email, and updating SharePoint — inside a Scope called ‘Try’.
👉 Then I added a separate ‘Catch’ Scope, which runs only if the Try Scope fails (using Configure Run After).
👉 This way, I could log the error and send a Teams alert without stopping the flow.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. How can you handle errors in Power Automate flows?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔹 I usaually Common Error Handling Techniques:

1. Configure Run After:
➤ Lets you specify when an action should run — e.g., only if the previous action fails or is skipped.
📌 Used to send alerts or log errors when something goes wrong.

2. Scope with Run Status Check:
➤ Group actions inside a Scope, then use another Scope to handle success or failure.
📌 Helps in building try-catch-finally style logic.

3. Terminate Action:
➤ Used to end a flow early with a custom status (Success, Failed, Cancelled).

4. Failure Notifications:
➤ Add an action (like Send an email) in the error branch to notify admins or users.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. What are Expressions in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Expressions in Power Automate are used to manipulate data and add logic inside a flow. I use them when I need more control than basic actions can provide.

👉 For example, I’ve used expressions like formatDateTime() to format dates,
👉 if() to apply conditional logic inside actions,
👉 and length() to check if a list or array has items before proceeding.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Describe a flow you have built end-to-end: Have you used approval flows? How did you implement them?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Yes, I built an end-to-end leave approval workflow using Power Automate integrated with SharePoint, Outlook.

🔹 Step 1 – Trigger: 
👉 The process starts when a new leave request is submitted to a SharePoint list.

🔹 Step 2 – Flow Triggered: 
👉 A Power Automate flow is triggered automatically when a new item is created in the SharePoint list.

🔹 Step 3 – Condition Check: 
👉 I added a condition to check if the leave days are more than 5.
👉 If it's more than 5, the request goes to the senior manager for approval.
👉 Otherwise, it goes to the team lead.

🔹 Step 4 – Approval Process: 
👉 I used the Start and Wait for an Approval action. Based on the response: I updated the SharePoint item status.
👉 If approved, the SharePoint list is updated with the new status.
👉 If rejected, the flow updates the status and sends a rejection message.

🔹 Step 5 – Notifications: 
👉 The flow sends an email via Outlook and a Teams message to notify the employee about the outcome.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. What is Concurrency Control in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Concurrency Control is used to manage how many flow runs happen in parallel when looping through items — especially in actions like "Apply to Each."

🔹 How I used it: In one flow, I was processing SharePoint list items and sending emails. 
👉 Initially, Power Automate ran all iterations in parallel, which caused issues — like Rate limits ⛔ and Sending emails out of order 📬.
👉 So, I turned on Concurrency Control, set the degree of parallelism to 1, and ensured that actions ran one at a time in sequence ✅
