Hi [Interviewer’s Name], A very good afternoon. Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity.
I'm Manoj Kumar, I’m from Tirupati, 
and I have 3.5 years of experience as a Power Platform Developer in my current organization.

I mainly work on Power Apps, Power Automate, SharePoint and Dataverse.

My role starts with understanding the business requirements from business stakeholders. 
Based on those requirements, I designed the canvas app with a responsive UI so it works across any devices – whether it's a desktop, tablet, and mobile.

(Business stakeholders means: could be clients, end users, business teams, or managers who give you the requirements)

I have developed applications using both Canvas Apps and Model-Driven Apps.

I have integrated with different data sources like Sharepoint, Dataverse.

I have also designed and implemented Power Automate workflows to handle approval processes, automated email notifications.

Hi [Interviewer’s Name], Good Morning. 
First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity.

My name is Manoj Kumar, and I’m from Tirupati. I completed my graduation in B.Sc. Computer Science from S.V. University.

I have around 3+years of experience as a Power Apps Developer in my current organization, I have worked on multiple projects built from scratch.
— I was responsible for end-to-end Canvas App development, including UI design, Power Fx logics, and integration with SharePoint Online.
— I’ve also designed and implemented Power Automate workflows to handle approval processes, automated email notifications.

I’ve worked on two major projects — one for Steelcase and another for Herbalife, both are US-based clients.


🔹 Roles & Responsibilities:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
– I started by closely understanding the business requirements — like what users needed and expected from the application.

– Based on that, I designed UI the app layout and user experience to align with client needs.

– Built the app from scratch using Canvas App with a fully customized UI using galleries, forms, buttons, dropdowns, and icons.

– I used SharePoint Online Lists as the backend data source to store and manage data. 

– I implemented Validation rules to maintain data quality (for ex, make sure email and phone numbers are entered in the correct format.

– I designed the app with a responsive UI so it works across any devices – whether it's a desktop, tablet, and mobile.

– Once the development was complete, I conducted end-to-end testing covering all data and UI scenarios.

– I shared the app with stakeholders, gathered feedback for UI improvements or validations.

– Finally, I published the app and configured proper role-based permissions to ensure secure access.
