1. Explain about SharePoint:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 SharePoint is a web-based collaboration and document management platform developed by Microsoft. 
👉 It’s widely used in organizations to store, share, manage, and collaborate on content, data, and documents securely.

🔷 I’ve used SharePoint Online mainly as a data source for Power Apps:
— It provides Lists for storing structured data (like tables).
— It provides Document Libraries for storing and managing files (like Word, PDF, Excel).
— Supports features like version control, permissions, metadata, views, and approval workflows.

2. Difference Between SharePoint List and SharePoint Library?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔷 I’ve used both SharePoint Lists and Libraries, and they serve different purposes:

— SharePoint List is mainly used to store structured data in a tabular format — similar to Excel,
— where each item is like a row with multiple fields like text, choice, date, etc.

— SharePoint Library is designed to store documents/files such as PDFs, Word docs, and images. 
— It supports features like version history, check-in/check-out, and metadata tagging.

3. Difference Between Team Site and Communication Site in SharePoint?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔷 I’ve worked with both Team Sites and Communication Sites, and the key difference lies in their purpose and audience:

— Team Site is designed for collaboration within a team or department. 
— It supports two-way communication, where members can add, edit, and share content like documents, lists, and tasks. 
— It’s usually connected to a Microsoft 365 group (Teams, Planner, Outlook).

— Communication Site is meant for broadcasting information to a wider audience, like the entire organization. 
— It focuses on one-way communication, where only a few people manage the content, and others mainly view it. 
— It’s ideal for HR portals, company announcements, or training pages.
