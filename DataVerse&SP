2. What is Table, Relationships and Database in Dataverse?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
A table is used to store data, similar to a SharePoint list or Excel table. 
For example:
In TA Complaints Management, we can create a Complaints table to store complaint details like Complaint Type, Complaint Name, Status, and lot more columns.

A relationship is used to connect two tables. 
For example: 
we can connect the Employee table and Complaints table using Employee ID. This helps to link related data and access it easily.
1. One-to-Many (1:N): "One record in Table A can be related to multiple records in Table B."
Example:
One Employee can have many Complaints.
So, Employee table is connected to Complaints table using Employee ID.

2. Many-to-One (N:1): "Many records in Table A are related to one record in Table B."
Example:
Many Employees belong to one Department.
So, Employee table is connected to Department table using Department ID. (It is the reverse view of One-to-Many)

3. Many-to-Many (N:N): "Many records in Table A can be related to many records in Table B."
Example:
One Employee can work on multiple Projects, and one Project can have multiple Employees.
So, Employee table and Project table have many-to-many relationship.

The database in Microsoft Dataverse is the overall data storage system where all tables, relationships, and data are stored securely.
It acts as the backend for Power Apps.
