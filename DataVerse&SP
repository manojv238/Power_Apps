5. What is Business Process Flow(BPF)?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 A Business Process Flow (BPF) is a visual and guided workflow that helps users to follow a set of predefined steps to complete a business process.
👉 It standardizes data entry, enforces business rules, and ensures consistency across teams by guiding users through different stages of a process.

✅ In my previous project, I used Business Process Flow (BPF) in a model-driven app to streamline the Customer Onboarding process. 
✅ The business needed a standardized, step-by-step guide for sales representatives to follow, ensuring no critical step was missed.
🔹 I created a BPF with stages like Lead Qualification → Account Setup → Document Collection → Final Approval.
🔹 At each stage, I added mandatory fields (steps) like Email, Company Name, Document Upload.
🔹 I implemented branching logic, so if any document was missing, the user couldn’t proceed.
🔹 I also configured role-based access, so only managers could approve at the final stage.

2. Difference Between SharePoint List and SharePoint Library?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔷 I’ve used both SharePoint Lists and Libraries, and they serve different purposes:

— SharePoint List is mainly used to store structured data in a tabular format — similar to Excel,
— where each item is like a row with multiple fields like text, choice, date, etc.

— SharePoint Library is designed to store documents/files such as PDFs, Word docs, and images. 
— It supports features like version history, check-in/check-out, and metadata tagging.

3. Difference Between Team Site and Communication Site in SharePoint?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔷 I’ve worked with both Team Sites and Communication Sites, and the key difference lies in their purpose and audience:

— Team Site is designed for collaboration within a team or department. 
— It supports two-way communication, where members can add, edit, and share content like documents, lists, and tasks. 
— It’s usually connected to a Microsoft 365 group (Teams, Planner, Outlook).

— Communication Site is meant for broadcasting information to a wider audience, like the entire organization. 
— It focuses on one-way communication, where only a few people manage the content, and others mainly view it. 
— It’s ideal for HR portals, company announcements, or training pages.
