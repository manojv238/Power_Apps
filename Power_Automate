2. How many types of flows in Power Automate?

🔹 Power Automate has mainly three types of flows:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Triggered automatically by specific events or conditions.
👉 For Example, when a new item is added to a SharePoint list, an email is received, or a file is created in OneDrive,
    the flow runs automatically to perform predefined actions.

2. INSTANT FLOW: 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Manually triggered by users, typically through a button press. (in Power Apps or the Power Automate mobile app).
👉 It allows users to start actions on demand, such as sending approvals, notifications, or triggering a process when needed.

3. SCHEDULED FLOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Runs at a set schedule — like daily, weekly, or monthly — to automate repetitive tasks.
👉 For Example, such as generating reports, data synchronization, or system cleanups.

3.  What are Triggers and Actions in Power Automate?

TRIGGERS:
━━━━━━━━━
👉 A trigger is the starting point of a flow — it defines when the flow should run.
👉 It listens for specific events — like when a new record is created, an email is received, etc.

ACTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━
👉 An action is what the flow does after the trigger fires.
👉 Actions are the steps that execute in sequence — like sending emails, updating records, creating files, etc.
