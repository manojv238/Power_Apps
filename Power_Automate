1. What is Power Automate?

👉 Power Automate is a cloud-based service that enables users to automate workflows between apps and services, without writing code.
👉 It allows users to create automated workflows by connectiong different "triggers and actions",
    such as a sending notifications or managing approvals and syncing data across platforms.

2. How many types of flows in Power Automate?

1. AUTOMATED FLOW: 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Triggered automatically by specific events or conditions.
👉 For Example, when a new item is added to a SharePoint list, an email is received, or a file is created in OneDrive,
    the flow runs automatically to perform predefined actions.

2. INSTANT FLOW: 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Manually triggered by users, typically through a button press. (in Power Apps or the Power Automate mobile app).
👉 It allows users to start actions on demand, such as sending approvals, notifications, or triggering a process when needed.

3. SCHEDULED FLOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Runs at a set schedule — like daily, weekly, or monthly — to automate repetitive tasks.
👉 For Example, such as generating reports, data synchronization, or system cleanups.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. What are Triggers and Actions in Power Automate?

TRIGGERS:
━━━━━━━━━
👉 A Trigger is the starting point of any flow — it defines the event that initiates the workflow.
👉 I’ve used various triggers like — like When an item is created in SharePoint, When an email arrives in Outlook, etc.

ACTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━
👉 An Action is the step that gets executed after a trigger fires. ("Each flow can have multiple actions")
👉 It’s what the flow actually does — like sending an email, updating records, creating files, etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. What is the purpose of conditions in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Conditions in Power Automate allow flows to execute specific actions based on logic criteria.
🔹 For example:
👉 In a leave approval process, I set a condition to check if the leave days are more than 5. If yes, the approval goes to the senior manager; if no, it goes to the team lead. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What is parallel branching in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Parallel branching to run multiple actions or sets of actions at the same time within a flow.

🔹 For example, in one workflow, after a form submission, I set up parallel branches to:
👉 Send a confirmation email, Update a SharePoint list, and Notify the team in Teams.
👉 All these actions ran simultaneously, improving performance and reducing wait time compared to step-by-step execution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. How can you handle errors in Power Automate flows?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔹 I usually handle errors in Power Automate flows using:
👉 Configure Run After ---> I use this to run specific actions only when the previous one fails, is skipped, or times out.
👉 Scope with Try-Catch Pattern ---> I wrap actions in a Scope block (Try), and if anything fails, the Catch scope handles logging or sending alerts.
👉 Terminate Action ---> I use this to end a flow with a custom status (Succeeded, Failed, Cancelled).
👉 Send Notifications ---> If something goes wrong, I trigger an email or Teams message to inform the relevant team.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. What are expressions in Power Automate?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Expressions in Power Automate are used to manipulate data and add logic inside a flow. I use them when I need more control than basic actions can provide.

👉 For example, I’ve used expressions like formatDateTime() to format dates,
👉 if() to apply conditional logic inside actions,
👉 and length() to check if a list or array has items before proceeding.
