1. What is Power Automate?

👉 Power Automate is a cloud-based service that enables users to automate workflows between apps and services, without writing code.
👉 It allows users to create automated workflows by connectiong different "triggers and actions",
    such as a sending notifications or managing approvals and syncing data across platforms.

2. How many types of flows in Power Automate?

1. AUTOMATED FLOW: 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Triggered automatically by specific events or conditions.
👉 For Example, when a new item is added to a SharePoint list, an email is received, or a file is created in OneDrive,
    the flow runs automatically to perform predefined actions.

2. INSTANT FLOW: 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Manually triggered by users, typically through a button press. (in Power Apps or the Power Automate mobile app).
👉 It allows users to start actions on demand, such as sending approvals, notifications, or triggering a process when needed.

3. SCHEDULED FLOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Runs at a set schedule — like daily, weekly, or monthly — to automate repetitive tasks.
👉 For Example, such as generating reports, data synchronization, or system cleanups.

3. What are Triggers and Actions in Power Automate?

TRIGGERS:
━━━━━━━━━
👉 A Trigger is the starting point of any flow — it defines the event that initiates the workflow.
👉 I’ve used various triggers like — like When an item is created in SharePoint, When an email arrives in Outlook, etc.

ACTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━
👉 An Action is the step that gets executed after a trigger fires. ("Each flow can have multiple actions")
👉 It’s what the flow actually does — like sending an email, updating records, creating files, etc.
