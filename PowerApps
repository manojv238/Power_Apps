1. Explain in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Apps is a low-code platform by Microsoft that enables us to build custom business applications quickly and efficiently.
    without the need for heavy traditional coding.
👉 It allows us to connect to various data sources like SharePoint, Dataverse, SQL, and even external APIs using connectors.

👉 I primarily work with Canvas Apps, where I design interactive UIs and implement logic using Power Fx formulas.
👉 I also integrate Power Apps with Power Automate to automate tasks like sending approvals, notifications, or updating records in real time.

👉 The main goal of Power Apps is to simplify and speed up application development for internal business needs,
    reduce manual work, and improve the productivity.

✅ Summary Note:
👉 Power Apps (Canvas and Model-Driven) are for internal business use only and cannot be used to create truly public-facing apps.

2. Difference between Canvas App and Model-Driven App?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1️⃣ Canvas Apps:
👉 We can start with a blank screen and design the app using a drag-and-drop components, Use Power Fx formulas to handle logic.
👉 Canvas gives full control over the app layouts and UI from scratch, adding different elements like buttons,galleries,forms, etc.
👉 we can Connect to multiple data sources like SharePoint, Excel, SQL, Dataverse, etc.

2️⃣ Model-Driven Apps:
👉 Model-Driven Apps are best for complex scenarios with structured data in Dataverse.
👉 User Interface(UI) is automatically generated based on data models stored in Dataverse.
👉 We can create forms, views, tables, that are automated generated based on the data entities adn relationships.

✅ “In short, Canvas = full design control, Model-Driven = full data structure control.”

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
