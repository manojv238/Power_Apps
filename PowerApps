1. Explain in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Apps is a low-code platform Developed by Microsoft that enables us to build custom business applications quickly and efficiently.
    without the need for heavy traditional coding.
👉 It allows us to connect to various data sources like SharePoint, Dataverse, SQL, and even external APIs using connectors.

👉 I primarily work with Canvas Apps, where I design interactive UIs and implement logic using Power Fx formulas.
👉 I also integrate Power Apps with Power Automate to automate tasks like sending approvals, notifications, or updating records in real time.

👉 The main goal of Power Apps is to simplify and speed up application development for internal business needs,
    reduce manual work, and improve the productivity.

✅ Summary Note:
👉 Power Apps (Canvas and Model-Driven) are for internal business use only and cannot be used to create truly public-facing apps.

2. Difference between Canvas App and Model-Driven App?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1️⃣ Canvas Apps:
👉 We can start with a blank screen and design the app using a drag-and-drop components, Use Power Fx formulas to handle logic.
👉 Canvas gives full control over the app layouts and UI from scratch, adding different elements like buttons,galleries,forms, etc.
👉 we can Connect to multiple data sources like SharePoint, Excel, SQL, Dataverse, etc.

2️⃣ Model-Driven Apps:
👉 Model-Driven Apps are best for complex scenarios with structured data in Dataverse.
👉 User Interface(UI) is automatically generated based on data models stored in Dataverse.
👉 We can create forms, views, tables, that are automated generated based on the data entities adn relationships.

✅ “In short, Canvas = full design control, Model-Driven = full data structure control.”

3. Variables and types of Variables in power apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Variables are used to store and manage data temporarily while app is running.
👉 It allows me to hold values like type numbers, text strings, boolean, record, table..etc.

🔹 Types of Variables in Power Apps:
1. Global Variables (Set):
👉 Used anywhere in the app, across all screens. Created using the Set() function.
✅ Syntax: Set(varCountry, "india") ----- Set(varName,"value")

2. Context Variables (UpdateContext):
👉 Only available on the current screen. Created with UpdateContext() function.
✅ Syntax: UpdateContext({ varName: "Manoj" })

4. Collections and types of Collections in power apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Collections is a group of items or i can say group of infomation that you can create, edit, and use inside your app.

🔹 Types of Collections in Power Apps:
1. Collect() Function:
👉 The Collect() function is used to create a new collection or add records to an existing collection.
✅ Syntax: Collect(MyCollection, {Name: "Alice", Age: 25}) ------ {Name:TextInput.text, Age:Value(TextInput.text)}

2. ClearCollect() Function:
👉 The ClearCollect() Function is used to remove all the existing records from collection, it allows me add a new record.
✅ Syntax: ClearCollect(MyCollection, {Name: "Alice1", Age: 20})

3. Clear() Function:
👉 The Clear() function is used to remove all records (rows) from a collection.
✅ Syntax: Clear(MyCollection)

5. Components in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Components are reusable building blocks and customizable UI elements like buttons,text labels,headers and even custom controls.
    that can be created once and we can used across multiple screens or apps.
✅ For example:-
👉 I created a dynamic left navigation component as a custom control, which was used across all screens in the app. 
👉 It included dynamic icons, screen names, navigation logic, and custom properties to handle active tab highlighting and role-based visibility.

👉 Using this component significantly improved the user experience, reduced development effort, 
    and made updates easy — a single change reflected throughout the app instantly.

✅ 1. Input Property : Input Property is used to provide values or information to the component from the outside.
✅ 2. Output Property: Output Property is used to communicate information or trigger actions based on what happening inside the component.
