1. Explain in Power Apps?

ANSWER✅:
Power Apps is a low-code platform by Microsoft that enables us to build custom business applications quickly and efficiently.
without the need for heavy traditional coding.
It allows us to connect to various data sources like SharePoint, Dataverse, SQL, and even external APIs using connectors.

I primarily work with Canvas Apps, where I design interactive UIs and implement logic using Power Fx formulas.
I also integrate Power Apps with Power Automate to automate tasks like sending approvals, notifications, or updating records in real time.

The main goal of Power Apps is to simplify and speed up application development for internal business needs,
reduce manual work, and improve the productivity.
