1. Explain in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Apps is a low-code platform by Microsoft that enables us to build custom business applications quickly and efficiently.
    without the need for heavy traditional coding.
👉 It allows us to connect to various data sources like SharePoint, Dataverse, SQL, and even external APIs using connectors.

👉 I primarily work with Canvas Apps, where I design interactive UIs and implement logic using Power Fx formulas.
👉 I also integrate Power Apps with Power Automate to automate tasks like sending approvals, notifications, or updating records in real time.

👉 The main goal of Power Apps is to simplify and speed up application development for internal business needs,
    reduce manual work, and improve the productivity.

✅ Summary Note:
👉 Power Apps (Canvas and Model-Driven) are for internal business use only and cannot be used to create truly public-facing apps.

2. Difference between Canvas App and Model-Driven App?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1️⃣ Canvas Apps:
We can start with a blank screen and design the app using a drag-and-drop components, Use Power Fx formulas to handle logic.
Canvas gives full control over the app layouts and UI from scratch, adding different elements like buttons,galleries,forms, etc.
we can Connect to multiple data sources like SharePoint, Excel, SQL, Dataverse, etc.

2️⃣ Model-Driven Apps:
Model-Driven Apps are best for complex scenarios with structured data in Dataverse.
User Interface(UI) is automatically generated based on data models stored in Dataverse.
it’s perfect for apps like service ticketing or asset tracking, where the process flow matters more than design.
