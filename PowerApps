1. Explain in Power Apps?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Power Apps is a low-code platform by Microsoft that enables us to build custom business applications quickly and efficiently.
    without the need for heavy traditional coding.
👉 It allows us to connect to various data sources like SharePoint, Dataverse, SQL, and even external APIs using connectors.

👉 I primarily work with Canvas Apps, where I design interactive UIs and implement logic using Power Fx formulas.
👉 I also integrate Power Apps with Power Automate to automate tasks like sending approvals, notifications, or updating records in real time.

👉 The main goal of Power Apps is to simplify and speed up application development for internal business needs,
    reduce manual work, and improve the productivity.

✅ Summary Note:
👉 Power Apps (Canvas and Model-Driven) are for internal business use only and cannot be used to create truly public-facing apps.

2. Difference between Canvas App and Model-Driven App?

EXPLAIN IN ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1️⃣ Canvas Apps:
Design-first approach: We can start with a blank screen and design the app using a drag-and-drop components, use Power Fx for logic.
Canvas gives full control over the app layout and user interface from scratch.
when I need to build custom, responsive apps with multiple data sources like SharePoint or Excel.

2️⃣ Model-Driven Apps
