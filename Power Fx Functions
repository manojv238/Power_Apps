1. PATCH() Function:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 The PATCH() Function in Power Apps is used to create, update or modify records in a data source.
✅ For example:
👉 If i only want to update the Specific fields of a record without affecting any other data, that time it will help to me.

🔍 Explanation: You want to UPDATE the age of the employee whose ID = 3 to Age = 35:
➡️ Patch(Employees, LookUp(Employees, ID = 3), {Age: 35})

2. LOOKUP() Function:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 The LookUp() function is used to search a data source and return a single record (or a single value) that matches a condition.
✅ For example:
👉 Find the record of the employee whose ID is 3:
➡️ LookUp(Employees, ID = 3) ---> This returns the entire record for the employee with ID = 3.

3. FILTER() Function:

7. Differnce between ComboBox AND DropDown Controls?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ DropDown Control: 
👉 DropDown control lets users select a single value from a list of predefined options.
👉 It’s simple and ideal when the choices are few and selection is limited to one.

✅ ComboBox Control:
👉 ComboBox control allows users to select single or multiple values, and also supports searching/filtering through the options.
👉 It is more flexible and interactive than a DropDown.
