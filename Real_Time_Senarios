1. What is your day-to-day activities and what is the process and what is the role and responsibilities? So how you worked on it?

In my day-to-day work activities, 
I mainly focus on developing and maintaining applications using Power Apps, Power Automate, SharePoint, and Dataverse. 
I usually start my day by checking my assigned tasks and attending the daily Srcum meeting where I discuss my progress and any blockers. 
Based on the requirements given by the business users, I analyze the requirement, design the data structure, and decide whether to use SharePoint or Dataverse. 
Then I develop the Power App, connect it to the data source, and implement the business logic using formulas and conditions.

I also create Power Automate flows to automate processes like approval workflows, email notifications, and updating data automatically. 
After development, I test the application, fix any issues, and support the UAT process with business users. 
Once everything is approved, I deploy the solution to production. 

Apart from development, I also handle bug fixes, performance improvements, and enhancements based on user feedback. 
Overall, my role involves end-to-end development, automation, deployment, and support of Power Platform solutions.
At the end of day, I update task status in Azure Board and push my changes for review.

2. Can you tell me about your Current Project?

"In my recent project, I worked for Steelcase as a Power Apps Developer, 
where I developed internal business applications using Power Apps, Power Automate, Dataverse, and SharePoint.
The main objective of the project was to replace manual Excel-based processes with automated and centralized applications to improve efficiency and data accuracy.

I developed two major applications. 
The first was an Inventory Management Canvas App to track furniture stock across multiple warehouses.
It included features like search and filter, low-stock alerts, and role-based access control. 
The second was a Model-Driven Order Tracking application built on Dataverse to manage purchase orders and approvals. 
I also implemented approval workflows using Power Automate, automated notifications, handled security roles, and managed deployments. 
This project significantly reduced manual errors, improved tracking, and streamlined approval processes across departments."

3. How to call Power Apps to Power Automate:-

In my experience, we can call Power Automate from Power Apps by creating an instant cloud flow with the Power Apps trigger. 
First, I create a flow in Power Automate and select the 'Power Apps' trigger. 
Then I define the required input parameters such as ID, name, or any field that I want to pass from Power Apps. 
After creating the flow logic, like sending an email or updating Dataverse, I save the flow.

Then in Power Apps, I connect the flow using the Power Automate option and call it using the FlowName.Run() function. 
For example, when a user clicks a Submit button, I call the flow and pass the required parameters. 
This way, Power Apps triggers Power Automate to perform background operations like approvals, notifications.

4. Explain real-time challenges you faced while developing an app and how you overcame them?

I have faced a some of real challenges:

— While developing the export-to-Excel functionality in my application, 
one of the main challenges I faced was handling large datasets and data formatting issues. 
Business users wanted to export filtered records from a Gallery directly into Excel, but Power Apps does not have a built-in feature to generate Excel files. 
Initially, when I tried passing the entire collection to Power Automate, the flow performance was slow, and sometimes it failed due to payload size limits.

— In my project,
when users wanted to export Gallery data to Excel, I handled it using Power Apps and Power Automate together. 
When the user clicks the Export button, I pass the Gallery data to Power Automate in JSON format using the JSON function.
I use ShowColumns to send only the required fields instead of all columns, which improves performance. (ShowColumns(EmployeeList, "EmployeeName", "EmployeeID"))
Now in Power Automate, the data is received as a JSON string, so the first thing I do is use the Parse JSON action.
This step is very important because it converts the JSON text into structured data so I can access individual fields.
Then I use the Create CSV table action to generate the file. 
After that, I use the Create file action in SharePoint or OneDrive for Busines to store the file.
Finally, I generate a shareable link and send it back in power apps so that user can download the Excel file. 

— Another challenge was handling date and number format conversions, 
so I implemented proper formatting expressions and added error handling using Scopes and Configure Run After. 
After implementing these improvements, the export process became stable, faster, and more reliable for users.

— One more challenge i was faced Delegation,
when I connected my app to a SharePoint list with thousands of items, only 500 records were loading due to delegation limits.
At first, it was really frustrating because users needed full data.
What I did was optimize my formulas with delegable functions like StartsWith() and Filter().
And in some cases where delegation still didn’t work, I called a Power Automate flow from the app to fetch only the required records.

6. When did you feel the app was tricky or difficult while developing it?

"One of the trickiest parts during development was when I had to handle dynamic visibility and role-based access in a Canvas App. 
Unlike model-driven apps, Canvas Apps don’t have built-in security roles, so I had to build a custom logic from scratch.

It was difficult because:
I had to ensure different roles (Admin, Manager, User) saw only what they were allowed to.
I had to secure not just screens, but also buttons, forms, and data visibility.
Testing this for different users without breaking other functionality was also challenging.

🔧 How I Overcame It:
I created a custom SecurityRoleList in SharePoint Datasource.
Each entry mapped a user's email to a role (Admin, Manager, etc.).
On app start, 
I used the User().Email function and stored the user’s role in a global variable:
Set(userRole, LookUp(SecurityRoleList, UserEmail = User().Email, Role))

Then, I used this variable to dynamically show/hide controls or navigate users:
If(userRole = "Admin", Navigate(AdminScreen), Navigate(UserScreen))

For buttons or components: Visible: userRole = "Manager"

7. How do you manage permissions in PowerApps?

In Power Apps, permissions are usually managed in two ways:
— One is at the data source level (SharePoint or Dataverse), 
— Another one is Azure AD groups.

In the App OnStart property, 
I write a variable to check whether the logged-in user belongs to a specific Azure AD group by using the Office365Groups connector. 
First, I connect the Office365Groups connector to the app. 
Then, I create a global variable using the Set() function and check the group membership using the group ID. 
For example, I write:

Set(varIsManager, Office365Groups.IsMemberOfGroup("GroupID", User().Email).value)

This variable stores true or false based on whether the user is a member of that Azure AD group. 
Then throughout the app, I use this variable to control permissions, such as showing or hiding buttons, enabling edit access, or restricting certain features. 
This approach helps implement role-based access control dynamically when the app starts."

In SharePoint, 
I handle permissions by using SharePoint groups and permission levels to control access to lists and libraries.
First, I create groups like Owners, Members, and Visitors, or custom groups such as Managers and Employees based on business requirements. 
Then I assign permission levels like Read for view-only access, Contribute for adding and editing records, and Full Control for complete access. 
This ensures users only have the permissions required for their role.

In Dataverse, 
I manage security using security roles, which control what users can access and what actions they can perform on specific tables. 
First, I create or modify a security role in the Power Platform Admin Center and define permissions 
like Create, Read, Write, Delete, Append, and Append To for the required tables.
For example, 
in my project, I created separate roles like Requestor, Manager, and Admin. 
Requestors had only Create and Read access to their records, while Managers had Read and Write access, and Admins had full control.

After creating the security role, I assign it to users either directly or through Dataverse teams,
This way, whenever a user is added to that group, they automatically get the assigned permissions.

8. How to move files from one folder to another folder using Power Automate? How do you achieve that?

In Power Automate, I move files from one folder to another using triggers and the Move file action from SharePoint or OneDrive connector. 
First, I create an automated cloud flow with a trigger like 'When a file is created in a folder' in SharePoint or OneDrive. 
This trigger detects whenever a new file is added to the source folder.

After the trigger, I use the 'Move file' action and specify the File Identifier from the trigger and the destination folder path where the file needs to be moved.
This automatically transfers the file from the source folder to the target folder. 
In some scenarios, I also add conditions to move files based on file name, extension, or status.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. There is a SP List 5 fields, so i want retire 2 fields only how do you achieve that?

To display only two fields instead of all fields, I handle it either in Power Apps using the ShowColumns function or in Power Automate using the Select action.

If I am doing it in Power Apps, I use ShowColumns to retrieve only the required fields. For example:
ShowColumns(EmployeeList, "EmployeeName", "EmployeeID")
This ensures only Employee Name and Employee ID are displayed in the Gallery or passed to Power Automate.

If I am handling it in Power Automate, after retrieving the records using Get items or List rows,
I use the Select action and map only the required fields like EmployeeName and EmployeeID. 
This way, the output will contain only those two fields instead of all columns.
This improves performance and ensures only required data is displayed or exported."

For example:
if I am retrieving employee data from SharePoint but only need specific records, 
I use the Get items action and apply an OData filter query like: EmployeeID eq 'EMP001'
This ensures Power Automate retrieves only the required records instead of all records.
If the data is already retrieved, I use the Filter array action to filter based on conditions like Employee Type or Status.
