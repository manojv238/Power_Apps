1. What is your day-to-day activities and what is the process and what is the role and responsibilities? So how you worked on it?

In my day-to-day work activities, 
I mainly focus on developing and maintaining applications using Power Apps, Power Automate, SharePoint, and Dataverse. 
I usually start my day by checking my assigned tasks and attending the daily Srcum meeting where I discuss my progress and any blockers. 
Based on the requirements given by the business users, I analyze the requirement, design the data structure, and decide whether to use SharePoint or Dataverse. 
Then I develop the Power App, connect it to the data source, and implement the business logic using formulas and conditions.

I also create Power Automate flows to automate processes like approval workflows, email notifications, and updating data automatically. 
After development, I test the application, fix any issues, and support the UAT process with business users. 
Once everything is approved, I deploy the solution to production. 

Apart from development, I also handle bug fixes, performance improvements, and enhancements based on user feedback. 
Overall, my role involves end-to-end development, automation, deployment, and support of Power Platform solutions.

👉 My day usually starts with a daily stand-up meeting, where I share yesterday’s progress, today’s plan, and if i have any blockers.
👉 After that, I pick the tasks form Azure Board, Tasks are assigned by the Team Lead or Project Manager through a Jira.
😎 These tasks like:
— sometimes it’s designing and building new Canvas apps or Model-Driven apps, 
— sometimes creating or updating Power Automate flows for approvals and notifications, 
— and other times enhancing existing apps with new features or bug any issues.

😎 During development:
— I focus a lot on responsive UI design for Canvas App, 
— Writing Power Fx formulas,
— handling delegation issues when working with large datasets in SharePoint,
— integrating with SharePoint or Dataverse, 
— and setting up role-based security in apps.
👉 I spend time on requirement discussions with the Business Analyst or Product Owner,
   — to make sure I fully understand the requirements and business needs before a starting development.
👉 Once development is done, I do unit testing for my features and support QA if needed.
👉 At the end of day, I update task status in DevOps/Jira Board and push my changes for review.

🎯 So overall, my role has been end-to-end development — designing, building, and automating workflows 
   — and these apps really helped the business by reducing manual errors, improving visibility, and speeding up approval cycles.

------------------------------

2. Can you tell me about your Current Project?

👉 Currently, I am working on the STEELCASE PROJECT, which is a leading furniture company in the US. I’m working as a Power Platform Developer,
   – where my role mainly involves developing and supporting business applications using Power Apps, Power Automate, Dataverse, and SharePoint.
😎 I’ve worked on two key applications in this project:
✅ First – the Inventory Management App (Canvas App):
🎯 Purpose: 
– Earlier, Steelcase was managing furniture stock using Excel, which caused manual errors and delays. 
– I developed a responsive Canvas App to track furniture stock across multiple warehouses.
👉 So in this app, I implemented features like:
------------------------------------------------
✔ Search and Filter option, so users don’t have to scroll through long lists. They can quickly find products by category, warehouse, or product name.
✔ I also designed a low-stock alert system. For example, if the quantity of any item goes below 5, a red warning symbol is shown to the warehouse manager.
✔ Another important feature was role-based access. The warehouse managers have edit rights, so they can update stock levels, 
  but normal staff members only have view access.
✔ Finally, I built a warehouse grouping view, where managers can compare inventory across different locations.

✅ Second – the Order Tracking App (Model-Driven App):
🎯 Purpose:
– Procurement teams earlier tracked purchase orders through emails and Excel, which was inefficient.
– So I built a Model-Driven App with Dataverse to monitor vendor purchase orders, delivery timelines, and approvals.
👉 So in this app, I implemented features like:
------------------------------------------------
✔ I designed custom Dataverse tables and forms to capture all purchase order details,
  I also built dashboards so that procurement teams could easily see pending approvals and vendor performance.
✔ For the workflow, I integrated Power Automate – whenever an order was created, it automatically sent an approval request to procurement managers. 
  Agents were only allowed to create or update orders, but managers had the final authority to approve or reject them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How to call Power Apps to Power Automate:-

In my experience, we can call Power Automate from Power Apps by creating an instant cloud flow with the Power Apps trigger. 
First, I create a flow in Power Automate and select the 'Power Apps' trigger. 
Then I define the required input parameters such as ID, name, or any field that I want to pass from Power Apps. 
After creating the flow logic, like sending an email or updating Dataverse, I save the flow.

Then in Power Apps, I connect the flow using the Power Automate option and call it using the FlowName.Run() function. 
For example, when a user clicks a Submit button, I call the flow and pass the required parameters. 
This way, Power Apps triggers Power Automate to perform background operations like approvals, notifications.

4. Explain real-time challenges you faced while working on Canvas App, and how you overcame them:

👉 While working on Canvas Apps, I faced a few real challenges:

— The biggest one was Delegation, For example:
when I connected my app to a SharePoint list with thousands of items, only 500 records were loading due to delegation limits.
At first, it was really frustrating because users needed full data.
What I did was optimize my formulas with delegable functions like StartsWith() and Filter().
And in some cases where delegation still didn’t work, I called a Power Automate flow from the app to fetch only the required records. 
🎯 Impact: The app became scalable and users could search across the entire dataset smoothly.

— Another challenge was Performance. 
In the beginning, the app was loading slow because too many data calls were happening. 
I fixed it by using collections to cache data and by loading data on-demand instead of all at once. 
🎯 Impact: The app performance improved a lot, and users had a much faster experience.

— I also had to deal with responsiveness.
Since the app was used on desktop, mobile, and tablets, the layout was not adjusting properly.
I handled that using containers for responsive design.
🎯 Impact: The app became responsive and worked well across all devices.

— Finally, Role-based Security.
SharePoint doesn’t provide row-level security by default in Power Apps.
I handled this by maintaining a UserRole list and using User().Email to apply conditional permissions and visibility.
🎯 Impact: Ensured data security and correct access for different user roles.

6. When did you feel the app was tricky or difficult while developing it?

"One of the trickiest parts during development was when I had to handle dynamic visibility and role-based access in a Canvas App. 
Unlike model-driven apps, Canvas Apps don’t have built-in security roles, so I had to build a custom logic from scratch.

It was difficult because:
I had to ensure different roles (Admin, Manager, User) saw only what they were allowed to.
I had to secure not just screens, but also buttons, forms, and data visibility.
Testing this for different users without breaking other functionality was also challenging.

🔧 How I Overcame It:
I created a custom SecurityRoleList in SharePoint Datasource.
Each entry mapped a user's email to a role (Admin, Manager, etc.).
On app start, 
I used the User().Email function and stored the user’s role in a global variable:
Set(userRole, LookUp(SecurityRoleList, UserEmail = User().Email, Role))

Then, I used this variable to dynamically show/hide controls or navigate users:
If(userRole = "Admin", Navigate(AdminScreen), Navigate(UserScreen))

For buttons or components: Visible: userRole = "Manager"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. How do you manage permissions in PowerApps?

👉 Yes, I’ve worked with permission handling in multiple projects.In Power Apps, permissions are usually managed in two ways:
— One is at the data source level (SharePoint or Dataverse), 
— Another one is app level using role-based logic.

👉 In SharePoint-based apps (Steelcase Inventory App):
— I used SharePoint list permissions. For example, item-level permissions were applied through Power Automate, 
— when a new item was created, the flow would break inheritance and give the creator full control, and assign read-only rights to a specific group.
— Inside the app, I also used the User() function to check the logged-in user and apply conditional visibility.
  Example: Only managers could see the “Approve” button, others couldn’t.

👉 In Dataverse-based apps (Steelcase Order Tracking App):
— Here it was more structured. I configured security roles in Dataverse, 
— Procurement Manager had approve rights, while Procurement Agent could only create and edit records.
— In the Model-Driven App, this worked automatically because security roles control what tables, fields, and rows each role can access.
— On top of that, I sometimes added Power Fx conditions in Canvas screens for hiding/showing controls based on role.
