1. TA Complaints Management System Project Explanation:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Main Objective:
The main objective of the TA Complaints Management System was to create a centralized platform,
where users can submit their complaints and track the status easily,
and administrators can manage and resolve complaints efficiently.

Problem Solved:
Before this system, complaints were handled manually, which caused delays, lack of tracking, and poor transparency.
I solved this problem by automating the entire process using Power Apps and Power Automate, 
which improved tracking, reduced manual work, and helped resolve complaints faster.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Can you tell me about your Current Project?

My recent project was "TA Complaints Management System", which I developed using Microsoft Power Platform.
The main objective of this project was to provide a centralized application where users can log complaints and easily track their complaint status. 
This helped replace the manual process and improved transparency and efficiency.

I developed a Canvas App & Model-Driven App based on the requirements. 
where I designed around 8 screens such as Home Screen, Log a Complaint, Complaint Search, Dashboard, Reporting, Complaints Overview, and View Complaints. 
Each screen had a specific role and functionality.

I used Dataverse and SharePoint as backend data sources to securely store and manage complaint data and attachments.

I implemented various Power Apps controls such as Galleries to display complaint records, Forms to display enter the fields and lot more..

I also implemented role-based access using Azure AD Grops, where different users like Managers, Developers, and Business Users had different access levels. 
Based on user roles,I'll display specific controls and data were displayed according to business requirements.

Additionally, 
I developed Power Automate flows to automate processes. 
One key feature I implemented was exporting complaint data to Excel. 
When the user selects report such as report names and date range and clicks the export button, 
the flow automatically generates and exports the data to Excel.

I also developed reporting and dashboard screens to allow users to search, filter, and analyze complaint records easily.

Overall, my role involves end-to-end development, automation, deployment, and support of Power Platform solutions.

2. What is your day-to-day activities and what is the process and what is the role and responsibilities? So how you worked on it?

My day-to-day activities mainly involve developing and maintaining applications using Power Apps, Power Automate, Dataverse and SharePoint. 
First, I check the requirements from business users and understand what changes or new features they need. 
Based on that, I design or modify the Power Apps screens, forms, and logics.
I connect the app to the SharePoint/Dataverse as a data source, implement business logic, and test the functionality. 
I also work on role-based access, Data validation, and improving performance if needed.

Apart from development, I also handle bug fixes, performance improvements, and enhancements based on user feedback. 
I also work with Power Automate when there is a requirement for workflow automation like approval processes.

Overall, my role involves end-to-end development, automation, deployment, and support of Power Platform solutions.
At the end of day, I update task status in Azure Board and push my changes for review.

3. How to call Power Apps to Power Automate:-

In my experience, we can call Power Automate from Power Apps by creating an instant cloud flow with the Power Apps trigger. 
First, I create a flow in Power Automate and select the 'Power Apps' trigger. 
Then I define the required input parameters such as ID, name, or any field that I want to pass from Power Apps. 
After creating the flow logic, like sending an email or updating Dataverse, I save the flow.

Then in Power Apps, I connect the flow using the Power Automate option and call it using the FlowName.Run() function. 
For example, when a user clicks a Submit button, I call the flow and pass the required parameters. 
This way, Power Apps triggers Power Automate to perform background operations like approvals, notifications.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Explain real-time challenges you faced while developing an app and how you overcame them?

I have faced a some of few challenges:
While developing the export-to-Excel functionality in my application, 
Business users wanted to export filtered records from a Gallery directly into Excel, but Power Apps does not have a built-in feature to generate Excel files. 

— In my project,
when users wanted to export Gallery data to Excel, I handled it using Power Apps and Power Automate together. 
When the user clicks the Export button, I pass the Gallery data to Power Automate in JSON format using the JSON function.
I use ShowColumns to send only the required fields instead of all columns, which improves performance. (ShowColumns(EmployeeList, "EmployeeName", "EmployeeID"))

Now in Power Automate, the data is received as a JSON string, so the first thing I do is use the Parse JSON action.
This step is very important because it converts the JSON text into structured data so that I can access individual fields.
After that, I can easily use those fields in actions like Create CSV table, 
then I use the Create file action in SharePoint or OneDrive for Busines to store the file.
Finally, I generate a shareable link and send it back in power apps so that user can download the Excel file. 

  ("I use JSON format because it is the standard way to send structured data from Power Apps to Power Automate. 
  When I export data from a Gallery, there are multiple records and multiple fields, 
  so JSON helps represent that data in a structured format with key-value pairs.")

— One more i faced the challenge is Deligation, 
I faced while working with large datasets in Power Apps was dealing with delegation limits when connecting to a SharePoint list with thousands of records. 
By default, Power Apps was only loading 500 records, which meant users couldn’t access the complete data they needed.
To resolve this, I first optimized my formulas by using delegable functions,
which allowed Power Apps to query data directly from SharePoint instead of loading it locally. 
his significantly improved data retrieval and ensured users could access relevant records efficiently.

However, in some scenarios where delegation was still not fully supported, 
I implemented Pagination to manage large datasets more effectively.
Instead of loading all records at once, I displayed a fixed number of records per page, such as 50, 100, 200, 500.

I achieved this by:
Creating variables to track the current page number and page size
Using functions like FirstN() and LastN() to display only the required records for each page
Adding Next and Previous buttons so users could navigate easily between pages.
This approach improves app performance, reduces data load, and provides a better user experience, especially when working with large datasets.

6. How do you manage permissions in PowerApps?

In my project, 
I implemented role-based permissions using Azure AD groups. 
I connected the Office365Groups connector in Power Apps and used the App OnStart property to check whether the logged-in user belongs to a specific group.
I created a global variable using the Set() function and used Office365Groups.IsMemberOfGroup function to verify the user’s group membership. 
This variable stores true or false based on whether the user is a member of that Azure AD group. 
For example:- 
In the App OnStart property, I used the User().Email function and stored the user’s role in a global variable:
✅ Set(varIsManager, Office365Groups.IsMemberOfGroup("GroupID", User().Email).value)
Based on this variable, 
I use control permissions, such as showing or hiding buttons, enabling edit access, or restricting certain features. 
This approach helps implement role-based access control dynamically when the app starts.

In SharePoint:
I manage permissions using SharePoint list permissions. I assign users or groups with permission levels like Read, Contribute, or Edit.
First, I create groups like Admins, Manager, and Users based on business requirements. 
Then I assign permission levels like Read for view-only access, Contribute for adding and editing records, and Full Control for complete access. 
For example:- 
In the App OnStart property, I used the User().Email function and stored the user’s role in a global variable:
✅ Set(userRole, LookUp(SecurityRoleList, UserEmail = User().Email, Role))
Based on this variable, 
I use control permissions, such as showing or hiding buttons, enabling edit access, or restricting certain features.
This ensures users only have the permissions required for their role.

In Dataverse:
I manage permissions using security roles, which control what users can access and what actions they can perform on specific tables. 
First, I create a security role in the Power Platform Admin Center and define permissions like Create, Read, Write, Delete for the required tables.
Then I assign those roles to users. This ensures users can only access the data based on their role.

7. How to move files from one folder to another folder using Power Automate? How do you achieve that?

In Power Automate, I move files from one folder to another using triggers and the Move file action from SharePoint or OneDrive connector. 
First, I create an automated cloud flow with a trigger like 'When a file is created in a folder' in SharePoint or OneDrive. 
This trigger detects whenever a new file is added to the source folder.

After the trigger, I use the 'Move file' action and specify the File Identifier from the trigger and the destination folder path where the file needs to be moved.
This automatically transfers the file from the source folder to the target folder. 
In some scenarios, I also add conditions to move files based on file name, extension, or status.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

8. There is a SharePoint List 5 fields, So I want retrive 2 fields only how do you achieve that?

To display only two fields instead of all fields, I handle it either in Power Apps using the ShowColumns function or in Power Automate using the Select action.

If I am doing it in Power Apps, I use ShowColumns to retrieve only the required fields. 
For example:
🙌 ShowColumns(EmployeeList, "EmployeeName", "EmployeeID")
This ensures only Employee Name and Employee ID are displayed in the Gallery or passed to Power Automate.

If I am handling it in Power Automate, after retrieving the records using Get items or List rows,
I use the Select action and map only the required fields like EmployeeName and EmployeeID. 
This way, the output will contain only those two fields instead of all columns.
This improves performance and ensures only required data is displayed or exported."

For example:
if I am retrieving employee data from SharePoint but only need specific records, 
I use the Get items action and apply an OData filter query like: EmployeeID eq 'EMP001'
This ensures Power Automate retrieves only the required records instead of all records.
If the data is already retrieved, I use the Filter array action to filter based on conditions like Employee Type or Status.

9. In Power apps how to upload multiples files form SharePoint Library?

In my application, 
I upload multiple files to a SharePoint Document Library by using the Attachment control in Power Apps along with Power Automate. 
First, I add an Attachment control in Power Apps to allow users to select multiple files. 
This control supports multiple file selection using the MaxAttachments property.

Next, I create a flow in Power Automate with the trigger "Power Apps (V2)". 
In the flow, I use the Create file action from SharePoint and configure the Site Address and Document Library where files need to be stored.

Since multiple files are coming from Power Apps, I use an Apply to each loop in the flow to process each file individually. 
Inside the loop, I pass the file name and file content, and the Create file action uploads each file to the SharePoint Document Library.
This approach, all selected files are uploaded successfully to the SharePoint Document Library.
