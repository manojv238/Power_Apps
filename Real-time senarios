How to call Power Apps to Power Automate:-

"Yes, Iâ€™ve worked on calling Power Automate from Power Apps in several use cases. Here's how I approach it:
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: I create an Instant cloud flow in Power Automate
I use the PowerApps trigger as the starting point.
If I need to pass values like user input or form data, I use â€˜Ask in PowerAppsâ€™ inside actions like Initialize variable or Compose.
Then, I add logic like creating a SharePoint item or sending email.
If needed, I include a â€˜Respond to PowerAppsâ€™ action to return data like a confirmation message or record ID back to the app.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: In Power Apps, I call the flow using the .Run() function
For example, in a buttonâ€™s OnSelect, I use:
SubmitFlow.Run(TextInput1.Text)
This passes user input directly to the flow.
I also handle success/failure messages using Notify() funtion for better user experience.
