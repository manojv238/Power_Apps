1. How to call Power Apps to Power Automate:-

"Yes, I’ve worked on calling Power Automate from Power Apps in several use cases. Here's how I approach it:
🔹 Step 1: I create an Instant cloud flow in Power Automate
I use the PowerApps trigger as the starting point.
If I need to pass values like user input or form data, I use ‘Ask in PowerApps’ inside actions like Initialize variable or Compose.
Then, I add logic like creating a SharePoint item or sending email.
If needed, I include a ‘Respond to PowerApps’ action to return data like a confirmation message or record ID back to the app.

🔹 Step 2: In Power Apps, I call the flow using the .Run() function
For example, in a button’s OnSelect, I use:
SubmitFlow.Run(TextInput1.Text)
This passes user input directly to the flow.
I also handle success/failure messages using Notify() funtion for better user experience.

2. Explain real-time challenges you faced while working on Canvas App and Model-Driven App, and how you overcame them:

🔹 Challenge-1: Delegation Limit with SharePoint (5000+ items)
---------------------------------------------------------------
"In one of my Canvas Apps, we were using SharePoint as the data source, and the list had more than 5000 records.
Because of the delegation limit, only 500 records were loading, and filters or searches didn’t work properly for the full list.

💡 How I Solved It:
I used delegable functions like Filter() and StartsWith() instead of non-delegable ones like Search() and ForAll().
Indexed the columns in SharePoint (like Title, Status) to support delegation.
Implemented pagination logic when needed, using FirstN() and Skip() for loading large datasets in smaller chunks.
Used ClearCollect() on app start to store only required filtered data locally to improve performance.

🔹 Challenge-2: File upload from Power Apps to SharePoint
---------------------------------------------------------
"In one of my Canvas App projects, users needed to upload files like images or PDFs and store them in a SharePoint document library.
But Canvas Apps don’t support direct file uploads to SharePoint."

💡 How I Solved It:
I used the Add Picture control to allow users to select a file.
Triggered a Power Automate flow using .Run(): UploadFileFlow.Run(AddMediaButton1.Media, "filename.pdf")
In the flow:
Used the PowerApps trigger to receive the file.
Converted the media to Base64.
Used the Create file action to upload it to a SharePoint document library.


💨 If they ask, “Did you face any other challenges?”, you can say:

😎 "Yes, I’ve also handled tricky scenarios like role-based screen visibility and optimizing form performance, 
    but these two were the most impactful in terms of user experience and technical resolution."

3. 💬 When did you feel the app was tricky or difficult while developing it?

"One of the trickiest parts during development was when I had to handle dynamic visibility and role-based access in a Canvas App. 
Unlike model-driven apps, Canvas Apps don’t have built-in security roles, so I had to build a custom logic from scratch.

It was difficult because:
I had to ensure different roles (Admin, Manager, User) saw only what they were allowed to.
I had to secure not just screens, but also buttons, forms, and data visibility.
Testing this for different users without breaking other functionality was also challenging.

🔧 How I Overcame It:
I created a custom SecurityRoleList in SharePoint Datasource.
Each entry mapped a user's email to a role (Admin, Manager, etc.).
On app start, 
I used the User().Email function and stored the user’s role in a global variable:
Set(userRole, LookUp(SecurityRoleList, UserEmail = User().Email, Role))

Then, I used this variable to dynamically show/hide controls or navigate users:
If(userRole = "Admin", Navigate(AdminScreen), Navigate(UserScreen))

For buttons or components: Visible: userRole = "Manager"
