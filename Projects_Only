1. TA Complaints Management System Project Explanation:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Main Objective:
The main objective of the TA Complaints Management System was to create a centralized platform,
where users can submit their complaints and track the status easily,
and administrators can manage and resolve complaints efficiently.

Problem Solved:
Before this system, complaints were handled manually, which caused delays, lack of tracking, and poor transparency.
I solved this problem by automating the entire process using Power Apps and Power Automate, 
which improved tracking, reduced manual work, and helped resolve complaints faster.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
My recent project was TA Complaints Management System, which I developed using Microsoft Power Platform.
The main objective of this project was to provide a centralized application where users can log complaints and easily track their complaint status. 
This helped replace the manual process and improved transparency and efficiency.

I developed a Canvas App & Model-Driven App based on the requirements. 
where I designed around 8 screens such as Home Screen, Log a Complaint, Complaint Search, Dashboard, Reporting, Complaints Overview, and View Complaints. 
Each screen had a specific role and functionality.

I used Dataverse and SharePoint as backend data sources to securely store and manage complaint data and attachments.

I implemented various Power Apps controls such as Galleries to display complaint records, Forms to capture user input lot more.

I also implemented role-based access control, where different users like Managers, Developers, and Business Users had different access levels. 
Based on user roles and regions such as Ireland and UK, specific controls and data were displayed according to business requirements.

Additionally, 
I developed Power Automate flows to automate processes. 
One key feature I implemented was exporting complaint data to Excel. 
When the user selects report such as report names and date range and clicks the export button, 
the flow automatically generates and exports the data to Excel.

I also developed reporting and dashboard screens to allow users to search, filter, and analyze complaint records easily.

My overall work was to design, develop, and deploy the application, manage data storage, create workflows, and provide support.

1. STEELCASE PROJECT EXPLANATION IN REAL-TIME:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📘 Project Description:

👉 Steelcase is one of the oldest and largest furniture manufacturers in the USA, 
   specializing in the design, production, and distribution of integrated office furniture, architectural solutions, and workplace technologies. 

👉 As a Power Apps Developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing business applications to automate internal operations and streamline workflows.
--------------------------------------
🔧 Key Responsibilities & Highlights:
---------------------------------------
👉 Developed Canvas Apps for internal teams including:

1. Inventory Management App    – to track furniture stock and optimize asset availability across warehouses.
2. Purchase Order Tracking App – enabled procurement teams to monitor vendor orders and delivery timelines.

👉 Integrated SharePoint Online lists and DataVerse as data sources for real-time data operations.

👉 Used Power Automate to build automated workflows for:
✅ Approval processes and sending Notifications

👉 Designed responsive and role-based UIs tailored to department-specific needs.

👉 Applied patch functions, collections, and delegation techniques to improve performance and scalability.

👉 Ensured data security using SharePoint permissions and Power Apps role-based access control.

------------------------------------------------------------
✅ App 1: Inventory Management App – Responsive Canvas App:
------------------------------------------------------------
👉 In the Inventory Management App for Steelcase, We mainly tracked Steelcase’s office furniture products:
For example:
🪑 Office Chairs – ergonomic chairs, task chairs, lounge seating
🖥️ Desks – adjustable desks, fixed desks, collaborative tables
🗄️ Storage Units – cabinets, mobile pedestals, lockers
🧩 Partitions & Panels – modular partitions for open spaces
🛠️ Accessories – monitor arms, power modules, whiteboards
🔧 Spare Parts – chair wheels, desk legs, and other replaceable components

📈 Finally Impact:
------------------
🎯 Replaced manual tracking:
— Earlier they were tracking inventory manually in Excel, manual methods to track inventory,
— now with the canvas app, all records are digital, stored in SharePoint, and easily accessible.

🎯 Reduced errors:
— Since the app uses structured forms with validation and direct integration with SharePoint.
— it reduced Manual data entry mistakes like duplicate items, wrong quantities, or missing fields.

🎯 Improved Warehouse visibility:
— Warehouse staff can now quickly search or filter stock based on category or location and see accurate, real-time availability
— something not possible with manual tracking

🎯 Saved time:
— With this app, the team saved a lot of time — they no longer had to search through Excel or call each location. 
— Everything was centralized and quick to update or access.

--------------------------------------------------
✅ App 2: Order Tracking App – Model-Driven App:
--------------------------------------------------
🎯 Purpose:
"I developed a Model-Driven Order Tracking App to help the procurement team track vendor purchase orders, monitor delivery timelines, 
 and manage approval workflows using structured Dataverse tables."

🔧 Key Highlights:
🧱 Model-Driven Design:
– Built using Dataverse tables, forms, views, dashboards
– UI auto-generated and responsive by default
– Navigation customized using the App Designer with a custom Site Map

📈 Final Impact:
------------------
🎯 Replaced manual order tracking:
— Earlier, POs were tracked using Excel and email threads
